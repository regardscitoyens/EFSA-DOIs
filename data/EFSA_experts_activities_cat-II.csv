None of the officers of CASAS receives salary and the titles are symbolic and were assigned simply for the purpose of incorporation. In this period the scientific activity of CASAS has been based on the volunteer contribution of the members and is documented by unfunded investigations published in peer reviewed journals on the topics of expertise of the members. CASAS is a nonprofit public benefit corporation comprising five scientists and is not organized for the private gain of any person. It is operating under the nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable purposes. The primary purposes are exclusively charitable and educational within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the ""Code"") and Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, as amended, including, without limitation to any future relevant code. The humanitarian goal of CASAS is to provide low cost analysis of complex agro-ecosystem problems in diverse cropping/medical/veterinary/pastoral systems in Agrica for the benefit of local communities. A second major focus is to provide donor governments and international agencies with comprehensive ecosystem level analyses so that they can better target meager resources to the solution of critical food production and environmental, human and veterinary health problems. This has become especially critical in the face of climate change. CASAS is not involved in decision making and implementation of management schemes that are completely entrusted to the stakeholders.
