In this period the scientific activity of CASAS has been based on the volunteer contribution of the members and is documented by unfunded investigations published in peer reviewed journals on the topics of expertise of the members. CASAS is a nonprofit public benefit corporation comprising five scientists and is not organized for the private gain of any person. It is operating under the nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable purposes. The primary purposes are exclusively charitable and educational within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the ""Code"") and Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, as amended, including, without limitation to any future relevant code. The humanitarian goal of CASAS is to provide low cost analysis of complex agro-ecosystem problems in diverse cropping/medical/veterinary/pastoral systems in Agrica for the benefit of local communities.
