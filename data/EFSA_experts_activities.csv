Since 2012 these research priorities have been : 1) development of diagnostic platforms that can be used on farms (on site diagnostics), 2) development of markers for robustness in animals, 3) gut health in chickens en 4) development of new diagnostics for antibiotic resistance. ad 1) aimed at production diseases in general, but the advise does not include specific diseases, because it is directed at the technique itself, it will certainly not include notifiable diseases (prohibited for AHS, task of CVI) and also does not include vector borne diseases and there is no plan to include them; ad 2) does not include specific diseases, longevity of cattle is the outcome parameter; ad 3) does also not include specific diseases, because here the challenge is to define a healthy gut (in contrast to gut diseases); ad 4) this aims at identifying new techniques that can more quickly (than bacterial culture) identify antimicrobial resistance in order to chose the right treatment more quickly. In my opinion there has been no overlap between this consultancy and my work for EFSA, neither as a panel member, nor as a member or chair of a WG. To phrase this specifically for the chairing: There has been no overlap with the mandate on Rift Valley Fever, AHS does not have any activity in this area nor is planning one. The consultancy also has never had any involvement with bovine TB. Moreover vector borne diseases have not and will not be part of the consultancy, because that is restricted to the topics listed above and will be for the coming year (by December 2015 the contract will be reevaluated or can be stopped).

Within this regard, the use of stabilized chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as a suitable disinfection treatment is proposed. We will try to establish if stabilized ClO2 could be a suitable disinfection treatment to assurance the compliance with the established microbial limits, particularly fecal indicator bacteria such as E. coli. First, agricultural waters from different water sources will be characterized by microbiological and physicochemical parameters. Optimal operational conditions for stabilized ClO2 as a suitable disinfection treatment will be established first at a pilot scale. After that, demonstration of practical, effective and environmentally sustainable agricultural water disinfection treatment will be carried out at commercial fields, where the impact of stabilized ClO2 on the environment will be also evaluated. We believe that the obtained conclusions will be very valuable for growers who will be able to integrate this technology in their water management practices"". The Center for Produce Safety (CPS), is a nonprofit public benefit corporation located in California with its principal place of business in 1477 Drew Avenue Davis, California. The CPS is a collaborative partnership that leverages the combined expertise of industry, government and the scientific and academic communities to focus on providing research needed to continually enhance food safety. This level of collaboration allows CPS to fill the knowledge gaps on produce food safety. CPS is largely a volunteer-run organization, with just three paid staff and minimal overhead. In 2014, CPS funded research projects in 9 states, from California to Massachusetts, from Michigan to Colorado. CPS was launched as a public-private partnership and is now international in scope with projects in 5 countries around the globe. This center does not depend on the UC Davies.

Member of a scientific advisory entity,,Belgian federal agency for safety of the food chain,"The Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) lays down the operational standards applicable to businesses and integrates all official control and inspection services for the safety of the food chain (microbiological and chemical food safety), animal and plant diseases and animal welfare. The Scientific Committee consists of scientific experts who are independent from the Agency and are employed by universities and research centers in Belgium. The Committee is completely autonomous and is in charge of risk assessment. It gives its opinion on draft regulations and on the control plans. Moreover, it sees to it that the Food Agency work proactively. It must identify problems in time and report them to allow the Agency to take the measures that are required, e.g. providing for an adequate survey system. The Scientific Committee has strictly no relation with risk management issues. The Scientific Committee has no activity related to the QPS mandate of EFSA. As expert I am involved in all microbiological safety issues the scientific committee is dealing with e.g. the risk assessment of listeria in smoked salmon, the risk and benefit analysis of the consumption of raw milk. The work on the evaluation of raw cows milk was finished in 2011 and the work on the evaluation of raw milk from other animals than cows in 2013. Both evaluations were published as advices on the internet of the Food Safety Agency. During 2014 an evaluation on the risks of consumption of raw dairy products will start. Risk assessment of genetically modified organisms does not belong to the tasks of the Food Agency and its scientific committee. Risk assessment of feed and food enzymes does not belong to the tasks of the Food agency and its scientific committee. With the committee we have 10 plenary meetings each of half a day spread over the year and about 10 working group meetings of half a day per year. As vice chair I have an additional 4 meetings of half a day per year (semestrial). I am vice chair of the committee since 2014.

FhG is financed by around two thirds by public finance and performs also research work for or with industrial partners. FhG employees are salaried according to the fare conditions for public servants. FhG can be qualified as a legal entity pursuing objectives which are of public interest and acting with the neutrality required. At Fraunhofer IVV my function is head of department 'Product Safety and Analytical Chemistry'. It is my responsibility to ensure appropriate scientific competence and analytical equipment available to carry out our scientific research activities in the area of analytical measurement, physico-chemical understanding and theoretical modeling of mass transport processes from one matrix (e.g. food contact materials) into the adjacent matrix (e.g. foods or food simulants). A large field of research within my department is on interactions between packaging materials and foods. We develop for instance new, alternative test procedures or new and better analytical methods or develop further our scientific understanding of mass transport processes through dedicated model studies. We are performing contract work for both public and private enterprises and undertake research projects for a wide benefit to society. Areas of contract work are: - Quality assurance of packed foods and consumer protection in relation to packaging materials. This includes investigations to identify and clarify sources and causes of technical problems related to the production and performance of food packagings. - Studies in the area of food safety related to innovative technologies such as in the area of recycling of food packaging plastics or the use of nanomaterials food packages. - Migration studies for compliance evaluation of food contact applications with regard to national, European and US FDA requirements - Determination of contaminants in foods - Development of analytical methods for the above purposes - Very rarely (~1 time per year) we overtake submission of a dossier to EFSA on a new FCM substance to be used by industry. - More frequently, in the area of recycled plastics for food contact we have prepared numerous dossiers for industry for submission to US- FDA as well as for evaluation by the EFSA. This is still ongoing but a largely reduced rate now. Finally, outside of my department, my institute undertakes applied research in the area of food packing material developments including also technological developments in the area of ‘active&intelligent’ packaging material. Potential conflicts of interest (CoI): I see a CoI with CEF Panel in the area of PET recycling: Considering the large number of dossiers on PET recycling we have prepared and filed to EFSA I have to declare here a general CoI. This refers to PET recycling only. In case of other polymer types I do not see a CoI. In case we have been involved in the preparation of a dossier from industry I will have a CoI, of course. However, this will be addressed always in the particular specific declaration of interest (SDoI). Regardless to that I emphasise that I am payed for my work by Fraunhofer according to public salary tariffs and that I do not receive any additional private or industrial payments for my work.",1987-10,now,2015-08-07,CEF_doi_005.pdf

It is not my job to implement such measures, but to carry out analytical work to support the management decisions with data. I am head of the group with the technical competence in GC-based analysis. The main duty is the analysis of samples taken from the market and the development of new analytical methods. We also investigate subjects considered to be a potential problem and provide the competence in such matter for the decision to be taken. We also communicate with colleagues of other enforcement authorities to harmonize evaluation and measures. Main subjects dealt with in the past: - Chromatographic technology, particularly gas chromatography. - Adulteration of expensive edible oils, such as olive oils. - Mineral oil of various sources in foods, food packaging materials (printing inks, recycled fibers), human milk and body fat. - Saturated hydrocarbons as oligomers from polyolefins (POSH) - Migrants from food packaging materials, such as can coatings, plasticizers from gaskets of lids or toys, various components from paper and board, printing inks and varnishes. - Migration of cyclo-diBA from can coatings. - Acrylamide: sources, ways for mitigation primarily in potato products. - Components formed by raffination of edible oils and fats. - Safety evaluation of coatings applied to pipes for water supply in house installations. - Barrier against the migration from recycled paperboard: development of a method for measuring efficiency; evaluation of various polymers Occasionally samples are analyzed for industry against payment, e.g. for lid producers or for determining mineral oil in recycled board or food, but such work does not involve industry-financed research projects.

Results were published on the website of the German BLE and in scientific journals. In 2011 and in 2013 the KLZH and the CVUA Stuttgart organized coordinated enforcement campaigns on the migration of plasticizers from the lids of glass jars into oils food.

The number of such ongoing or re-opened projects has been since February 2010 less than five and requires work forf 2-5 meetings per year. The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) is a Foundation of Public Law located in Im Neuenheimer Feld 280 | 69120 Heidelberg Germany. The legal remit is to perform research on cancer and described in full detail in https://www.dkfz.de/de/dkfz/download/Satzung.pdf. The expert's role in the organization and his/her main tasks during the employment from 1979 to 2010 was to perform biostatistical research to support the centers remit by in the design and analysis of experimental and clinical studies of the research on cancer. The organisation does not make direkt use of the results of this work, except registering scientific puablication in its reports The work is restricted to give advice in design, evaluation of the data and publication of the results of biomedical studies related to cancer. The organisation has no official responsibility to carry out risk management and is exclusively engaged in the science risk assessment and evaluation related to the incidence and treatment of cancer. The work reported here concerns also Biostatistical research and application of mathematical and statistical methods in the 7th Framework Project BASELINE EU Grant Agreement No 222 738 in a part time contract of 12-34 h/months which ends in 2013 The BASELINE project's objective is to provide harmonised and validated sampling strategies, to support the European policies in food safety and to be suitable for food producers, in order to collect comparable data to improve quantitative risk analysis of selected biological and chemical agents. My work for the project is to support workpackage 6 (WP6) on Model Development by supportimg the WP 6 leader located at the DKFZ in the development of predictive mathematical models for biological risks and investigate and model sources and pathways of chemical contaminants to improve sampling schemes. This is obtained by a review of existing and definition of new mathematical models in predictive microbiology; investigation of correlations between food risk factors and traceable environmental parameters and contamination indicators; consolidation of existing and new models for microbial growth as a function of intrinsic environmental factors and extrinsic parameters. This refers to the previous work for the project done in the function as previous Department Head and previous WP 6 Leader which ended by retirement from the DKFZ in 2010 reported under VI.

Employment,,"Technical University of Denmark, National Food Institute","The Technical University (DTU) has the following main objectives: education, research, public sector consultancy and innovation. DTU does not participate in development of pesticides in view of their authorisation. DTU does not perform risk management but as stated below we perform research based scientific advising and risk assessment which can be used by the Danish authorities in risk management and decision making. DTU has not developed or published risk assessment guidance or methodologies that are used in the regulatory process of pesticides. For pesticides we use the EFSA PRIMo model for intake calculations and comparison with ADI and ARfD. My main usual tasks are: - Performing research based scientific advising of the National Food Agency about exposure and risk assessment of contaminants and pesticides. - Perform research based advising of the Danish authorities as part of national authorisations for pesticides and before meetings in Codex and EU. - Research within probabilistic modelling. Have been granted access to the programme MCRA (developed by RIVM and Biometris in the Netherlands) so this programme is used for probabilistic calculations. - Teaching at DTU and University of Copenhagen in chemical risk assessment and exposure of contaminants including cumulative and probabilistic modelling. - Teaching in setting maximum limits for contaminants and pesticides. - Preparing Evaluation reports to and MRL proposals for some of the pesticides where Denmark is Rapporteur Member State (RMS). - Preparing evaluation reports for the Northern zone for some of the pesticides where Denmark is RMS. Funding is as a starting point from public money coming from the governmental funding of the University. For some work concerning evaluations of pesticides applicants pay a fee to the authorities and part of this fee is paid to DTU for performing the work. Teaching as part of external projects: - Has done teaching in Chemical Risk Assessment in the EU project Better Training for Safer Food in the period spring 2011 untill now. - Have performed teaching in chemical Risk Assessment in Ghana, Ethiopia and Botswana as part of the EU project EDES from November 2012 to March 2014. The project continues until summer 2015. - Teaching in Chemical Risk Assessment in Saudi Arabia in 2012 as part of an agreement between DTU and the Saudi Arabian authorities. - Teashing in the course arranged and finansed by EFSA ""Training seminars on risk assessment for Pre-Accession countries in 2013 - chemical"" in July 2013.

From 1 April 2015, Fera moves from being a wholly-owned agency of UK Government (Defra) to Fera Science Limited, a joint venture between Capita (75% shareholding) and Defra (25% shareholding). This new arrangement means that Fera Science Limited will be legally classified as private sector overall, but will continue to provide independent evidence/advice to UK government as well as commercial services. Following discussions between Fera, FSA with EFSA, it has been agreed that the EFSA Management Board will consider an application from Fera Science Limited for continuation of Article 36 (and so Food Safety Organisation) status, on the grounds that the funding profile for Fera Science Ltd will be dominated by public sector funding, at least in the medium term. EFSA has advised that until the EFSA Management Board reaches a decision in June, Fera Science Limited will retain its current status with EFSA as a Food Safety Organisation, and would not anticipate any consequent changes in the eligibility of Fera staff to serve on EFSA committees. Fera has no official responsibility for food chemical risk management. My own role is to lead a team of scientific staff investigating environmental contaminants in food and their impact on human health.

In France, my research is mainly funded by public funds. As a Professor I receive money from the French Ministry of Agriculture (through INRA) and from the French Ministry of Education and Research (national public funds) My activity is related to feed additives (omega 3 fatty acids) and new raw materials in feed; I have worked in collaboration with The Ivory Coast on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in guinea pig nutrition; the last experiment was on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in hen and rabbit nutrition (from 2009 to now); Euphorbia heterophylla has a very high amount of omega 3 fatty acids; it is a plant that people destroy in Africa because this plant grows in the cotton fields and absolutely everywhere; this is the first work on this plant used for animal nutrition. And it is a good opportunity for animal producers to use this plant to feed their animals; the main consequences are a decrease in cholesterol content and an increase in the omega 3 content in animal products (meat and eggs); this is important in a poor region; the farmers can sell their products at a high price becasuse they are healthy; I work with a teacher from the Institut National polytechnique Felix Houphouet Boigny in Ivory Coast. The animals are resred in Ivory Coast and all the analyses are made in my Lab, I also write the papers in English My research activity is with INRA I got PhD grants from Valorex (feed company specialist of linseed) in 2012 for a PhD that will be finished in june 2015 on the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids in animal nutrition, using the rat as a model.

The work carried out relates to a starter culture model (model symbiosis S85), which is only used for research in order to exclude any competitive/commercial interest. By construction, this inter-syndicate strictly rules out the use of bacteria which are or could be utilised for commercial purposes. Meetings are held to define the terms of the call, select the best applications, meet face to face the applicants to refine the projects and follow up the progress reports (about 4/year). The follow up of the research projects implies meeting and auditing the public research teams which have been funded, in order to make sure that the proposed work is satisfactorily carried out. As the results have been obtained by using a non commercial starter culture, they cannot be used to support allegations related to other bacteria. Besides, most studies are related to very basic biological mechanisms or to methodological issues in microbiology and not to studies in vivo in humans.

NDA,"HIRSCH-ERNST, Karen Ildico",IV. Employment,,"Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung, Berlin, GERMANY","The central task of the BfR is the scientific risk assessment of food, feed, substances and products as the basis for the consumer health protection activities of the federal government. The Institute does not have any monitoring duties. However, it is involved in a number of reporting and authorisation procedures. To ensure that it can carry out its assessments without being influenced by political, economic or social interests, the Institute is independent by virtue of the Act establishing BfR. Thus, a major task of the BfR is to voice an opinion on the potential risks from food, consumer articles and chemicals, and to offer scientific advice to the federal ministries for their policy decisions. The BfR cooperates with a number of national and international, governmental and non-governmental agencies (FAO, WHO, OECD, etc.). It is the national Focal Point of EFSA and a partner of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The expert is the head of the Unit ""Nutritional Risks, Allergies and Novel Foods"" within the Department of Food Safety at the BfR. The main task of the Unit is the nutritional-physiological/nutritional- medical assessment of nutrients and other substances with physiological action in conventional foods, including food supplements and fortified foods, dietetic foods, novel foods and novel food ingredients, and food from genetically modified organisms. In addition, the Unit addresses questions on selected food risks and allergies. Furthermore, the Unit prepares opinions on infant formula, follow-up formula and weaning food. Moreover, the expert is responsible for the secretariat of the ""BfR Committee for Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Novel Foods and Allergies"" which is attached to the Unit. Main areas of work and research include: Risk assessment of secondary plant ingredients and other substances with specific nutritional or physiological effects; scientific assessment concepts for micronutrients and other food ingredients.",2014-06,now,2015-10-23,NDA_doi_005.pdf

Employment,,Wageningen University,"Education and Research I am employed as associate professor at Wageningen University, Plant Sciences Department, Centre for Crop Systems Analysis, Crop & Weed Ecology Group. My job is described as 45% teaching, 45% research and 10% management. Wageningen University is one of the premier agricultural universities in the world. It is the only university in the Netherlands to focus specifically on the theme ‘healthy food and living environment’. The remit of the organization is research and teaching (BSc, MSc and PhD level) in its domain of expertise. By being part of ""Wageningen University and Research Centre"", Wageningen University is associated with institutes that carry out legal functions and risk assessments in the domain of food and environmental safety. My research is on quantitative agro-ecology in a wide sense. This research aims at developing insights and tools for sustainable and healthy cropping systems that optimize production, resource use efficiency, and natural pest regulation based on natural mechanisms, including biotic interactions and spatial processes. I conduct, for instance, research on biological control of insects with viruses, dispersal of beneficial insects at field and landscape scale, disease spread at landscape scale and beyond, intercropping for high productivity and sustainable land use, ecology and biological control of weeds, and much more. My main strength is on the interface of field- based experimental studies and mathematical modelling. My teaching involves BSc-, MSc- and PhD-level courses in Population and Systems Ecology, Agrobiodiversity, Mathematics and Statistics, and Ecological Modelling. An important part of research is conducted in the form of PhD research. I have a large international network of collaborators. I have no role in risk management, and am not personally empowered to validate/take risk management actions/decisions. My role in management includes membership of the management team of the group which means taking decisions with respect to financial management, human resources, and other operational or strategic affairs.

Research funding,,"Dutch Science Foundation, Netherlands, The Hague, NWO","Living landscapes: recognizing and strengthening the contribution of ecosystem services (biological control, pollination) to crop yields, food security and farmer income in China Living landscapes comprise a diversity of land uses, amongst which agriculture is of prime importance for providing food security and sustaining the livelihoods of rural people, but where other functions such as biodiversity conservation, water storage and recreation should be harmoniously combined. Living landscapes support communities of beneficial insects that suppress pests and pollinate crops, which is critical to the productivity and sustainability of agriculture. These valuable services have generally suffered from intensification of agriculture (e.g. pesticide use) and simplification of agricultural landscapes. Here, we propose to conduct the first comprehensive study in China on the relation between landscape diversity and biological pest suppression and pollination. We will study biological control of plant hoppers and other pests in rice over a gradient of landscapes from highly diverse to simplified. Measurements will be made in farmers’ fields to determine the ecological interactions and economical trade- offs between biological control and pesticides as principal strategies for pest management. We will also quantify the effect of natural pollination by bees on the yield of oilseed rape, as influenced by landscape factors and crop management. Models of pest population dynamics and crop-pest relationships will be developed to predict level of ecosystem service in terms of yield increase and monetary value as a function of landscape diversity and crop management. Farmer surveys will be carried out to document farmer behaviour with regard to pest management strategies and analyse the driving factors. These surveys will provide data for quantitative economic analyses of farmers’ responses. Farmer valuation of ES will be contrasted to the empirically-based model calculations. We will determine how policies may be used to restore ecosystem services, increase yields, enhance farmer income, and reduce farmer exposure to pesticides. The research package aims at strengthening the functional role of landscape and habitat management for sustainable agriculture and food security in China.",2013-12,now,2015-11-23,PLH_doi_018.pdf
PLH,"VAN DER WERF, Wopke",VI. Research funding,,Dutch Science Foundation Tipping the system: the difficult transition from chemical towards,"natural pest control in agriculture Insecticides are used intensively for agricultural pest management, despite decades-long efforts to diminish pesticide dependency. We hypothesize that the transition to a more pesticide-independent agriculture is difficult to achieve because a pesticide-dependent agriculture suppresses beneficial biota that are needed for the transition to a pesticide-free agriculture, causing a “lock-in”. We further hypothesize that the pest management may be characterized as a dynamic system with alternative stable states. One stable state is characterized by dependency on insecticides and absence of effective populations of natural enemies. The other stable state is characterized by low or non-use of insecticides and presence of effective populations of natural enemies, suppressing pests. Each stable state is self- reinforcing due to positive feedback, and the transition from one state to the other is characterized by “tipping points”: critical points in the management intensity where the system switches from one stable state to the other. Moving to the pesticide-independent state requires a recovery process for which spatial and temporal scales have not been well characterized and may be landscape context specific. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of literature data, ecological modelling, farmer survey, and a field study at the landscape scale to test above hypotheses. We aim to establish under which set of conditions a coordinated effort between stakeholders has potential to “tip” the pest control system to an insecticide-independent state. This multi- disciplinary research will provide critically needed insight in the system dynamics underlying farmers’ pest control practices, and elucidate key principles governing a transition towards sustainable pest management.",2015-11,now,2015-11-23,PLH_doi_018.pdf

PPR,"BROCK, Theodorus",IV. Employment,,"Wageningen University and Research Centre, NETHERLANDS","The last 5 years, as an employee of Alterra (Wageningen University and Research Centre), I provided advice on how to interpret higher-tier toxicity data for the Dutch Board for the Registration of Biocides and Pesticides (Ctgb) and the chemical industry. This activity mainly concerns the interpretation of complex microcosm/mesocosm tests (performed by other institutes) and the writing of independent expert opinions on the exposure-response relationships that can be derived from these semi-field studies. These independent expert opinions are often required by regulatory authorities. On behalf of Alterra, and to support its internal quality assurance system, I act as internal reviewer of test protocols and final reports of semi-field experiments performed by Alterra under GLP and financed by the chemical industry and used for the registration procedure for pesticides. The goal of this internal quality assurance system is to critically review the scientific reports of studies (before their official publication) by an internal employee of Alterra not directly involved in these studies. On an annual basis approximately 100 h of my time is involved in these activities directly or indirectly funded by industry to Alterra.

It was established by the French government in 2005 to fund research projects, based on competitive schemes giving researchers the best opportunities to realize their projects and paving the way for ground-breaking new knowledge. The role of the Agency is to bring more flexibility to the French research system, foster new dynamics and devise cutting edge- strategies for acquiring new knowledge. By identifying priority areas and fostering private-public collaborations, it also aims at enhancing the general level of competitiveness of both the French research system and the French economy. Project-based research funding is known to stimulate research organisations and strengthen their synergies. The ANR’s approach to funding allows French research to reinforce its international position and better integrate the framework of European cooperation. ANR funds are available in all scientific fields, for both fundamental and industrial research and for public research organisations as well as private companies (through public/private partnerships). With a peer review process matching the highest international standards, ANR’s general goal is to fund excellent research, while also facilitating innovation and interdisciplinary work and developing European and international collaborations. The ANR is constantly attentive to the scientific community. Indeed, consulting the scientific community each year on the future needs in both fundamental and applied research is one of the agency’s priorities. The ANR’s goal is to identify themes which can respond not only to societal, environmental and economic needs, but also to technological and scientific challenges, through a broad consultation process. In order to enrich its portfolio of thematic programmes with the most strategic considerations, the Agency therefore implements a continuous foresight and programme planning process in which it consults the widest possible range of national and international stakeholders. ANR's programmes are organised in 6 thematic priorities: •Environment and Biological Resources •Engineering, Processes and Security •Health and Biology •Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies •Sustainable Energy •Social Sciences and Humanities Since July 2010, ANR's programme planning and selection processes are ISO 9001 certified.",2011-03,2014-04,2015-04-18,PPR_doi_003.pdf

PPR,"KLEIN, Michael",IV. Employment,,Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME),"Current position: senior scientist working for the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft at the Fraunhofer IME. Fraunhofer is Europe’s largest application-oriented research organisation organised in 67 institutes. The research efforts are geared entirely to people’s needs: health, security, communication, energy and the environment. In 2013 the total budget of Fraunhofer was 1661 M€. 1083 M€ was based on public money and 578 M€ based on industry resources (see http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/facts- and-figures/finances/contract-research-revenue-2009-2013.html). The industry money from the pesticide industry is insignificant when related to the whole Fraunhofer budget. I work at the Fraunhofer IME which undertakes applied research of direct utility to private and public enterprise and of wide benefit to society (mission). In 2014 the private fundig of the Fraunhofer IME summed up to 44.5 % (see http://www.ime.fraunhofer.de/en/about_us/institute_data.html). In 2014 my personal fraction of industry work was about 17%. I spend all my office time for IME-activities. The time I spend for attending meetings of the BfR-Commission the IME-activity only covers 2 %. Due to this mission the Fraunhofer IME is doing studies for authorities (e.g. UBA), but also for the pesticide industry to be used in the regulatory risk assessment. However, as a research institute Fraunhofer IME does not do any decisions on regulatory risk assessment or risk management. IME is also not doing pesticide research in the meaning of development of new pesticides. Instead, pesticide risk research is important at the Fraunhofer IME. This research is generally financed with public money. I am involved in this research which is usually not related to individual compounds but to processes and principles. Some examples for pesticide risk research at the IME (all funded with public money) are: Validation of FOCUS PELMO for a reliable prediction of the leaching potential of PPP into groundwater in Germany, Geodata based Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Plant Protection Products (GEORISK), Development of German FOCUS type run-off and drainage scenarios, endocrine disruption in invertebrates (GERDA) - reproduction test using aquatic snails, concept development for extended plant testing of veterinary medicinal products, participation in the development and OECD validation of fish tests for endocrine disruption and biomagnification, hepatocyte assay to predict the bioaccumulation of chemicals in fish, development of a dietary burden calculator for fish metabolism studies, estimation of reasonable application dates related to crop development, Fish Full Life Cycle Test protocol development, chronic effects after peak vs. flow-through exposure. The fraction of industry funding in the area of pesticide risk research at the IME is negligible. However, IME is involved in the provision of experimental studies used for regulatory risk assessment. These fate and effect studies are always studies on specific pesticides or products performed according to guidelines. A substantial fraction of the total industry money at the IME is based on these studies (36 % in 2012 and 2013). I am not involved in any of these experimental studies and have no overview what is actually analysed in the institute. (continued, please find part 2)",1987-06,now,2015-04-17,PPR_doi_007.pdf

The organization is NOT involved in regulatory assessment of pesticides. The organization has NOT developed and published any RA guidance or methodologies used in regulatory process (unless some of our results have been used without our knowledge). The organization is NOT the owner of software, etc., used in regulatory process. The organization is has NOT official capacity of Risk Management.

Appointing researchers and technical staff; supervising laboratory of ecotoxicology; heading the Institute Committee for Researchers Career. Detailed description of research activities: 1. All research conducted by my team is of purely scientific nature. However, as we are the ""ecotoxicology team"", our scientific activities cover research on various types of toxic chemicals, ranging from heavy metals (most of our work) through pesticides, detergents, PAHs, etc. 2. The chemicals used in our research are selected for solving particular scientific questions. So far, we used a rather limited set of pesticides (imidacloprid, dimethoate) and a few PAHs. I am not aware of any direct use of our results in registration dossiers. 3. Increasing the scientific knowledge is the core of our activity, apart from teaching. Results are published in international scientific journals. Some of the articles are aimed specifically on improving ecological risk assessment and, possibly, registration of chemicals but none of the projects completed by my team was directly connected to such activities.

Employment,,PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency,"The remit of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) is indepedent scientic assessment of national environmental policies. PBL works for the Dutch government, but has an independent scientific position. With respect to plant protection products, PBL has recently evaluated the environmental and socio-economic effects of the Dutch Policy Plan for Sustainable Plant Protection. The end-report of this evaluation has been published in Janurary 2012. As mentioned above, PBL is an independent body working mainly on a self-tasking basis (steered in a way that has much in common with the way EFSA is working). So, we EVALUATE environmental policy, but are NOT involved in the decision making process (risk-management). Our independent position also means that we are not allowed to work for NGO's or industry, so private funding is zero. PBL is therefore not involved in the development of pesticides or in the authorisation procedure of pesticides. Our independent position also means that we do not publish regulatory guidance. We are giving, however, scientific input to the development of such guidance, see activities III - Member of Scientic Advisory Body). One of the scientific inputs to guidance development, is the development of the model(s) that support such guidance. PBL is therefore involved in the development of PEARL and GeoPEARL, because this is seen as a scientific input. PBL is also owner (together with RIVM and Alterra) of these models. Within PBL, I am employed as a Senior Researcher Soil and Water. My main tasks are: (i) to coordinate the development and use of enviornmental fate models (pesticides, nutrients and other contaminants),(ii) to evaluate national environmental policy (pesticides, nutrients, soil), and (iii) give scientific input to the development of guidance for registration of pesticides (surface water, groundwater and soil). With respect to pesticides, I am responsible for development and use of the PEARL and GeoPEARL models (used for Dutch and European pesticide risk assessment and policy evaluation). This acitivity is funded by the Dutch government and carried out in co-operation with Alterra and RIVM.

I have participated in these meetings in an advisory role to the representative of the Dutch ministry of Public Health. The principal task of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) is to support the Dutch government in formulating its policy, by collecting and integrating knowledge worldwide and to conduct research where needed. RIVM is funded only by public money. The Act on the RIVM of 1996 stipulates that commissioning bodies will not have any influence on the organization and outcome of RIVM’s activities. RIVM is the official research facility for the ministries of ""Health Welfare and Sports"" and ""Infrastructure and the Environment"" in the Netherlands, and serves the Inspectorate for Public Health. RIVM also works for the ministries of ""Economic affairs, Agriculture, and Innovation"" and for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). RIVM is contracted by the Dutch Board for the Authorization of Pesticides and Biocides (Ctgb) to evaluate dossiers. RIVM has no vote in the authorisation of pesticides as such. RIVM has developed and published guidance or methodologies used in the regulatory process of pesticide authorisation and residue limits, and developed calculation tools and models in order to be transparant how proposed methodology is used. All programs have been paid for by public money and are available on a non-commercial basis. For dietary risk assessment: • MCRA: Monte Carlo Risk Assessment, developed for RIVM by WUR/Biometris [https://mcra.rivm.nl]. • SPADE: tool for food consumption data analysis [www.wiv-isp.be/aph/pdf/APH68_S41.pdf]. • Version 03 Dutch TMDI_NEDIcalculation.xlt and Version 05 Dutch NESTI calculation.xlt: Excelfiles for Dutch chronic and acute dietary risk assessment [www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/320005006.pdf]. • RIVM and Wageningen University developed the IPRA-method to estimate which fraction of the population is affected by substances in food (Van der Voet H, Slob W (2007) Risk Anal 27 351-71). • ETX 2.0: A program (in Excel) to fit log-normal distributions [www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/601501028.pdf] • PROAST:analysis of toxicological dose-response data [http://www.rivm.nl/en/foodnutritionandwater/foodsafety/proast.jsp] • GeoPearl and PEARL: pesticide leaching models jointly developed by RIVM, Alterra Wageningen UR, and the Netherlands Environmental Agency (PBL).

The number of such ongoing or re-opened projects has been since February 2010 less than five and requires work forf 2-5 meetings per year. The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) is a Foundation of Public Law located in Im Neuenheimer Feld 280 | 69120 Heidelberg Germany. The legal remit is to perform research on cancer and described in full detail in https://www.dkfz.de/de/dkfz/download/Satzung.pdf. The expert's role in the organization and his/her main tasks during the employment from 1979 to 2010 was to perform biostatistical research to support the centers remit by in the design and analysis of experimental and clinical studies of the research on cancer. The organisation does not make direkt use of the results of this work, except registering scientific puablication in its reports The work is restricted to give advice in design, evaluation of the data and publication of the results of biomedical studies related to cancer. The organisation has no official responsibility to carry out risk management and is exclusively engaged in the science risk assessment and evaluation related to the incidence and treatment of cancer. The work reported here concerns also Biostatistical research and application of mathematical and statistical methods in the 7th Framework Project BASELINE EU Grant Agreement No 222 738 in a part time contract of 12-34 h/months which ends in 2013 The BASELINE project's objective is to provide harmonised and validated sampling strategies, to support the European policies in food safety and to be suitable for food producers, in order to collect comparable data to improve quantitative risk analysis of selected biological and chemical agents. My work for the project is to support workpackage 6 (WP6) on Model Development by supportimg the WP 6 leader located at the DKFZ in the development of predictive mathematical models for biological risks and investigate and model sources and pathways of chemical contaminants to improve sampling schemes. This is obtained by a review of existing and definition of new mathematical models in predictive microbiology; investigation of correlations between food risk factors and traceable environmental parameters and contamination indicators; consolidation of existing and new models for microbial growth as a function of intrinsic environmental factors and extrinsic parameters. This refers to the previous work for the project done in the function as previous Department Head and previous WP 6 Leader which ended by retirement from the DKFZ in 2010 reported under VI.

We study the mechanisms of action and regulation of nutritional factors in situations of inflammation and infection. Our hypotheses are that new nutritional components (mainly issued from breast milk) could influence: (i) the immune system (gene expression) early in life and prevent and/or modulate inflammatory diseases later in life, (ii) the course of inflammatory and/or infectious disease as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis. Our aim is to understand at different periods of prenatal and postnatal development the mechanisms by which nutritional components can influence future health and prevent/treat inflammatory diseases.
