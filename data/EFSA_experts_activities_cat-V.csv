At other times, the discussions are more broad-ranging, focusing on strategies to tackle non-regulatory animal health issues on the island of Ireland and on issues relating to governance of the national TB programmes. In addition, I sit on an government-to-government (Ireland-Northern Ireland) TB/brucellosis committee, sharing scientific information relevant to these two disease eradication programmes.

"STEGEMAN, Jan Arend",V. Occasional consultancy,,Dutch Animal Health Service,"Member of Committee that advises on the research priorities of the Dutch Animal Health Service. Since 2012 these research priorities have been : 1) development of diagnostic platforms that can be used on farms (on site diagnostics), 2) development of markers for robustness in animals, 3) gut health in chickens en 4) development of new diagnostics for antibiotic resistance. ad 1) aimed at production diseases in general, but the advise does not include specific diseases, because it is directed at the technique itself, it will certainly not include notifiable diseases (prohibited for AHS, task of CVI) and also does not include vector borne diseases and there is no plan to include them; ad 2) does not include specific diseases, longevity of cattle is the outcome parameter; ad 3) does also not include specific diseases, because here the challenge is to define a healthy gut (in contrast to gut diseases); ad 4) this aims at identifying new techniques that can more quickly (than bacterial culture) identify antimicrobial resistance in order to chose the right treatment more quickly. In my opinion there has been no overlap between this consultancy and my work for EFSA, neither as a panel member, nor as a member or chair of a WG. To phrase this specifically for the chairing: There has been no overlap with the mandate on Rift Valley Fever, AHS does not have any activity in this area nor is planning one. The consultancy also has never had any involvement with bovine TB. Moreover vector borne diseases have not and will not be part of the consultancy, because that is restricted to the topics listed above and will be for the coming year (by December 2015 the contract will be reevaluated or can be stopped).

This refers to the previous work for the project done in the function as previous Department Head and previous WP 6 Leader which ended by retirement from the DKFZ in 2010 reported under VI.

The work carried out relates to a starter culture model (model symbiosis S85), which is only used for research in order to exclude any competitive/commercial interest. By construction, this inter-syndicate strictly rules out the use of bacteria which are or could be utilised for commercial purposes. Meetings are held to define the terms of the call, select the best applications, meet face to face the applicants to refine the projects and follow up the progress reports (about 4/year). The follow up of the research projects implies meeting and auditing the public research teams which have been funded, in order to make sure that the proposed work is satisfactorily carried out. As the results have been obtained by using a non commercial starter culture, they cannot be used to support allegations related to other bacteria. Besides, most studies are related to very basic biological mechanisms or to methodological issues in microbiology and not to studies in vivo in humans.

Center for the Analysis of Sustainable Agricultural Systems (CASAS), Kensington, CA, USA. CASAS is a nonprofit public benefit corporation comprising five scientists and is not organized for the private gain of any person. It is operating under the nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable purposes. The primary purposes are exclusively charitable and educational within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the ""Code"") and Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, as amended, including, without limitation to any future relevant code. The humanitarian goal of CASAS is to provide low cost analysis of complex agro-ecosystem problems in diverse cropping/medical/veterinary/pastoral systems in Africa for the benefit of local communities. A second major focus is to provide donor governments and international agencies with comprehensive ecosystem level analyses so that they can better target meager resources to the solution of critical food production and environmental, human veterinary health problems. This has become especially critical in the evolving face of climate change. CASAS is not involved in decision making and implementation of management schemes that are completely entrusted to the stakeholders. CASAS does not receive any funds from industries and agencies related to plant pests, their control or pest risk analysis related questions. Furthermore, risk analysis is not in the remit of CASAS. As member of CASAS I am involved without any remuneration in the development of analysis and modelling of eco-epidemiological systems for the prevention and control of arthropod-transmitted diseases in livestock (tick-borne diseases, tsetse-trypanosomiasis) and humans (malaria, sleeping sickness).",2008-08,now,2015-11-10,PLH_doi_005.pdf

The DOM programme received no funding from Binab, but ""in kind"" assistance in the study in the form of field sampling etc., and one Binab personnel was co-author on the publication. One aim of the DOM programme was that the new knowledge should be disseminated to stakeholders, such as governmental authorities, organisations as well as industry. Therefore, in my capacity as a researcher in the programme I contributed (unpaid) consulting to Binab. The deliverables to Binab consisted of my participation in meetings with them (2-3), other discussions (phone, e-mail) and one brief report on growth ability of their two fungi at different temperatures. My consultancy has hopefully contributed to a greater knowledge in the company about the fundamental properties of their biocontrol fungi. This knowledge could possibly become useful to them in their re- registration of their microbial active agents. But I have no information how they have used, or plan to use, this new knowledge, and I have no possibilities to have an impact on how Binab use this knowledge.
