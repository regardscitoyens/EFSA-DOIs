In France, my research is mainly funded by public funds. As a Professor I receive money from the French Ministry of Agriculture (through INRA) and from the French Ministry of Education and Research (national public funds) My activity is related to feed additives (omega 3 fatty acids) and new raw materials in feed; I have worked in collaboration with The Ivory Coast on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in guinea pig nutrition; the last experiment was on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in hen and rabbit nutrition (from 2009 to now); Euphorbia heterophylla has a very high amount of omega 3 fatty acids; it is a plant that people destroy in Africa because this plant grows in the cotton fields and absolutely everywhere; this is the first work on this plant used for animal nutrition. And it is a good opportunity for animal producers to use this plant to feed their animals; the main consequences are a decrease in cholesterol content and an increase in the omega 3 content in animal products (meat and eggs); this is important in a poor region; the farmers can sell their products at a high price becasuse they are healthy; I work with a teacher from the Institut National polytechnique Felix Houphouet Boigny in Ivory Coast. The animals are resred in Ivory Coast and all the analyses are made in my Lab, I also write the papers in English My research activity is with INRA I got PhD grants from Valorex (feed company specialist of linseed) in 2012 for a PhD that will be finished in june 2015 on the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids in animal nutrition, using the rat as a model.

These projects typically have several partners, most of them from academia and research institutes and some from the industry. This research is pre-competetive in nature and doesn't involve work performed to a specific industrial partner. My role in these projects has always been related to microbiology: pro- and prebiotics for humans, safety of lactic acid bacteria for humans (including antibiotic resistance), microbiological safety of foods, and topics related to nutrition and human microbiota. Currently ongoing are projects related to food safety, nutrition, host and microbiota. Feed companies have not been involved in these public projects.",2007-03,now,2015-09-10,FEEDAP_doi_016.pdf
