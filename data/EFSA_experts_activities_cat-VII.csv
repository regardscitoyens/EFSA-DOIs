The UBA has therefore ownership and decided about distribution and use of the model. It is one of the FOCUS leaching models and can be used in pesticide risk assessment. PELMO calculates PECgroundwater for pesticides. The model is currently in use in EU and national registration. It is planned to use it also as higher tier model for the calculation of PECsoil using the EFSA soil scenarios. Since 1991 it was updated several times to fulfill the requirements of guidance documents. The model distribution is organised via the official FOCUS websites and can be downloaded and used by everybody free of charge. Neither Fraunhofer nor my self have a financial gain because of the model.,1991-01,now,2015-04-17,PPR_doi_007.pdf
