FhG employees are salaried according to the fare conditions for public servants. FhG can be qualified as a legal entity pursuing objectives which are of public interest and acting with the neutrality required. At Fraunhofer IVV my function is head of department 'Product Safety and Analytical Chemistry'. It is my responsibility to ensure appropriate scientific competence and analytical equipment available to carry out our scientific research activities in the area of analytical measurement, physico-chemical understanding and theoretical modeling of mass transport processes from one matrix (e.g. food contact materials) into the adjacent matrix (e.g. foods or food simulants). A large field of research within my department is on interactions between packaging materials and foods. We develop for instance new, alternative test procedures or new and better analytical methods or develop further our scientific understanding of mass transport processes through dedicated model studies. We are performing contract work for both public and private enterprises and undertake research projects for a wide benefit to society. Areas of contract work are: - Quality assurance of packed foods and consumer protection in relation to packaging materials. This includes investigations to identify and clarify sources and causes of technical problems related to the production and performance of food packagings. - Studies in the area of food safety related to innovative technologies such as in the area of recycling of food packaging plastics or the use of nanomaterials food packages. - Migration studies for compliance evaluation of food contact applications with regard to national, European and US FDA requirements - Determination of contaminants in foods - Development of analytical methods for the above purposes - Very rarely (~1 time per year) we overtake submission of a dossier to EFSA on a new FCM substance to be used by industry. - More frequently, in the area of recycled plastics for food contact we have prepared numerous dossiers for industry for submission to US- FDA as well as for evaluation by the EFSA. This is still ongoing but a largely reduced rate now. Finally, outside of my department, my institute undertakes applied research in the area of food packing material developments including also technological developments in the area of ‘active&intelligent’ packaging material.

We also communicate with colleagues of other enforcement authorities to harmonize evaluation and measures. Main subjects dealt with in the past: - Chromatographic technology, particularly gas chromatography. - Adulteration of expensive edible oils, such as olive oils. - Mineral oil of various sources in foods, food packaging materials (printing inks, recycled fibers), human milk and body fat. - Saturated hydrocarbons as oligomers from polyolefins (POSH) - Migrants from food packaging materials, such as can coatings, plasticizers from gaskets of lids or toys, various components from paper and board, printing inks and varnishes. - Migration of cyclo-diBA from can coatings. - Acrylamide: sources, ways for mitigation primarily in potato products. - Components formed by raffination of edible oils and fats. - Safety evaluation of coatings applied to pipes for water supply in house installations. - Barrier against the migration from recycled paperboard: development of a method for measuring efficiency; evaluation of various polymers Occasionally samples are analyzed for industry against payment, e.g. for lid producers or for determining mineral oil in recycled board or food, but such work does not involve industry-financed research projects.

This work consists typically on testing materials for global and specific migration to verify compliance with legislation. These companies are, to my knowledge, not submitting any authorisation application to EFSA. In case it comes to my knowledge that a specific work performed by the lab is being used in an application to EFSA, I will immediately declare that to EFSA and will undertake the necessary measures in order to be not involved on the evaluations in question, using the Specific Declaration of Interest procedure for each meeting. The laboratory may occasionally test packages to verify if the level of Bisphenol A complies with the limit laid down in Regulation (EU) 10/2011. This work is developed for food companies and packaging manufacturers, that want to verify the compliance of their packages. The laboratory acts as National Reference Laboratory for Food Contact Materials appointed by the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture Sea Environment and Territory and performs the testing required on behalf of Portuguese surveillance authorities.

"KLEIN, Michael",IV. Employment,,Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME),"Current position: senior scientist working for the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft at the Fraunhofer IME. Fraunhofer is Europe’s largest application-oriented research organisation organised in 67 institutes. The research efforts are geared entirely to people’s needs: health, security, communication, energy and the environment. In 2013 the total budget of Fraunhofer was 1661 M€. 1083 M€ was based on public money and 578 M€ based on industry resources (see http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/facts- and-figures/finances/contract-research-revenue-2009-2013.html). The industry money from the pesticide industry is insignificant when related to the whole Fraunhofer budget. I work at the Fraunhofer IME which undertakes applied research of direct utility to private and public enterprise and of wide benefit to society (mission). In 2014 the private fundig of the Fraunhofer IME summed up to 44.5 % (see http://www.ime.fraunhofer.de/en/about_us/institute_data.html). In 2014 my personal fraction of industry work was about 17%. I spend all my office time for IME-activities. The time I spend for attending meetings of the BfR-Commission the IME-activity only covers 2 %. Due to this mission the Fraunhofer IME is doing studies for authorities (e.g. UBA), but also for the pesticide industry to be used in the regulatory risk assessment. However, as a research institute Fraunhofer IME does not do any decisions on regulatory risk assessment or risk management. IME is also not doing pesticide research in the meaning of development of new pesticides. Instead, pesticide risk research is important at the Fraunhofer IME. This research is generally financed with public money. I am involved in this research which is usually not related to individual compounds but to processes and principles. Some examples for pesticide risk research at the IME (all funded with public money) are: Validation of FOCUS PELMO for a reliable prediction of the leaching potential of PPP into groundwater in Germany, Geodata based Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Plant Protection Products (GEORISK), Development of German FOCUS type run-off and drainage scenarios, endocrine disruption in invertebrates (GERDA) - reproduction test using aquatic snails, concept development for extended plant testing of veterinary medicinal products, participation in the development and OECD validation of fish tests for endocrine disruption and biomagnification, hepatocyte assay to predict the bioaccumulation of chemicals in fish, development of a dietary burden calculator for fish metabolism studies, estimation of reasonable application dates related to crop development, Fish Full Life Cycle Test protocol development, chronic effects after peak vs. flow-through exposure. The fraction of industry funding in the area of pesticide risk research at the IME is negligible. However, IME is involved in the provision of experimental studies used for regulatory risk assessment. These fate and effect studies are always studies on specific pesticides or products performed according to guidelines. A substantial fraction of the total industry money at the IME is based on these studies (36 % in 2012 and 2013). I am not involved in any of these experimental studies and have no overview what is actually analysed in the institute. (continued, please find part 2)",1987-06,now,2015-04-17,PPR_doi_007.pdf

I am not aware of any direct use of our results in registration dossiers. 3. Increasing the scientific knowledge is the core of our activity, apart from teaching. Results are published in international scientific journals. Some of the articles are aimed specifically on improving ecological risk assessment and, possibly, registration of chemicals but none of the projects completed by my team was directly connected to such activities.

The end-report of this evaluation has been published in Janurary 2012. As mentioned above, PBL is an independent body working mainly on a self-tasking basis (steered in a way that has much in common with the way EFSA is working). So, we EVALUATE environmental policy, but are NOT involved in the decision making process (risk-management). Our independent position also means that we are not allowed to work for NGO's or industry, so private funding is zero. PBL is therefore not involved in the development of pesticides or in the authorisation procedure of pesticides. Our independent position also means that we do not publish regulatory guidance. We are giving, however, scientific input to the development of such guidance, see activities III - Member of Scientic Advisory Body). One of the scientific inputs to guidance development, is the development of the model(s) that support such guidance.

"BROCK, Theodorus",IV.

This activity mainly concerns the interpretation of complex microcosm/mesocosm tests (performed by other institutes) and the writing of independent expert opinions on the exposure-response relationships that can be derived from these semi-field studies. These independent expert opinions are often required by regulatory authorities. On behalf of Alterra, and to support its internal quality assurance system, I act as internal reviewer of test protocols and final reports of semi-field experiments performed by Alterra under GLP and financed by the chemical industry and used for the registration procedure for pesticides. The goal of this internal quality assurance system is to critically review the scientific reports of studies (before their official publication) by an internal employee of Alterra not directly involved in these studies. On an annual basis approximately 100 h of my time is involved in these activities directly or indirectly funded by industry to Alterra.
