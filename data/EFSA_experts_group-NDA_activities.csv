"BRESSON, Jean-Louis",V. Occasional consultancy,,Syndifrais (Fermented milk producers intersyndicate),"Bid and appraisal of call for tenders for scientific research projects about probiotic mechanisms of action and human microbiota effects on host. With colleagues, I am discussing the aim of the research, the methods chosen to carry it out and its timescale. The decision to select a project is a collective one. The work carried out relates to a starter culture model (model symbiosis S85), which is only used for research in order to exclude any competitive/commercial interest. By construction, this inter-syndicate strictly rules out the use of bacteria which are or could be utilised for commercial purposes. Meetings are held to define the terms of the call, select the best applications, meet face to face the applicants to refine the projects and follow up the progress reports (about 4/year). The follow up of the research projects implies meeting and auditing the public research teams which have been funded, in order to make sure that the proposed work is satisfactorily carried out. As the results have been obtained by using a non commercial starter culture, they cannot be used to support allegations related to other bacteria. Besides, most studies are related to very basic biological mechanisms or to methodological issues in microbiology and not to studies in vivo in humans.
