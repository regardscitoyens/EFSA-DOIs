CVERA is the national resource centre for veterinary epidemiology in Ireland, located within the UCD School of Veterinary Medicine at University College Dublin. The Centre was initially established as the Tuberculosis Investigation Unit, but in recent years has broadened its remit to cover a wide range of international, national and local animal health matters, including: • Epidemiological support for the control and eradication of regulatory animal diseases, which includes national programmes for bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and bovine spongiform encephalopathy; • Work in support of Animal Health Ireland, which is seeking to provide a proactive, coordinated and industry-led approach in Ireland to non-regulatory animal health concerns (such as mastitis, fertility and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis); and • Epidemiological support for a broad range of other animal health and welfare issues relating to emergency animal disease preparedness and response (for example, avian influenza, bluetongue and equine infectious anaemia), on-farm investigations, welfare of farmed livestock and horses, health of companion animals and farmed fish, and international collaboration. UCD CVERA staff work closely with national policy-makers, both in government and industry. Staff also contribute to training in veterinary medicine, both to undergraduates and postgraduate. A broad range of expertise is represented within the Centre, including agriculture and animal sciences, database development and management, geographic information systems, statistics, veterinary medicine and epidemiology.

Within this regard, the use of stabilized chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as a suitable disinfection treatment is proposed. We will try to establish if stabilized ClO2 could be a suitable disinfection treatment to assurance the compliance with the established microbial limits, particularly fecal indicator bacteria such as E. coli. First, agricultural waters from different water sources will be characterized by microbiological and physicochemical parameters. Optimal operational conditions for stabilized ClO2 as a suitable disinfection treatment will be established first at a pilot scale. After that, demonstration of practical, effective and environmentally sustainable agricultural water disinfection treatment will be carried out at commercial fields, where the impact of stabilized ClO2 on the environment will be also evaluated. We believe that the obtained conclusions will be very valuable for growers who will be able to integrate this technology in their water management practices"". The Center for Produce Safety (CPS), is a nonprofit public benefit corporation located in California with its principal place of business in 1477 Drew Avenue Davis, California. The CPS is a collaborative partnership that leverages the combined expertise of industry, government and the scientific and academic communities to focus on providing research needed to continually enhance food safety. This level of collaboration allows CPS to fill the knowledge gaps on produce food safety. CPS is largely a volunteer-run organization, with just three paid staff and minimal overhead. In 2014, CPS funded research projects in 9 states, from California to Massachusetts, from Michigan to Colorado. CPS was launched as a public-private partnership and is now international in scope with projects in 5 countries around the globe. This center does not depend on the UC Davies.

In France, my research is mainly funded by public funds. As a Professor I receive money from the French Ministry of Agriculture (through INRA) and from the French Ministry of Education and Research (national public funds) My activity is related to feed additives (omega 3 fatty acids) and new raw materials in feed; I have worked in collaboration with The Ivory Coast on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in guinea pig nutrition; the last experiment was on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in hen and rabbit nutrition (from 2009 to now); Euphorbia heterophylla has a very high amount of omega 3 fatty acids; it is a plant that people destroy in Africa because this plant grows in the cotton fields and absolutely everywhere; this is the first work on this plant used for animal nutrition. And it is a good opportunity for animal producers to use this plant to feed their animals; the main consequences are a decrease in cholesterol content and an increase in the omega 3 content in animal products (meat and eggs); this is important in a poor region; the farmers can sell their products at a high price becasuse they are healthy; I work with a teacher from the Institut National polytechnique Felix Houphouet Boigny in Ivory Coast. The animals are resred in Ivory Coast and all the analyses are made in my Lab, I also write the papers in English My research activity is with INRA I got PhD grants from Valorex (feed company specialist of linseed) in 2012 for a PhD that will be finished in june 2015 on the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids in animal nutrition, using the rat as a model.

Living landscapes support communities of beneficial insects that suppress pests and pollinate crops, which is critical to the productivity and sustainability of agriculture. These valuable services have generally suffered from intensification of agriculture (e.g. pesticide use) and simplification of agricultural landscapes. Here, we propose to conduct the first comprehensive study in China on the relation between landscape diversity and biological pest suppression and pollination. We will study biological control of plant hoppers and other pests in rice over a gradient of landscapes from highly diverse to simplified. Measurements will be made in farmers’ fields to determine the ecological interactions and economical trade- offs between biological control and pesticides as principal strategies for pest management. We will also quantify the effect of natural pollination by bees on the yield of oilseed rape, as influenced by landscape factors and crop management. Models of pest population dynamics and crop-pest relationships will be developed to predict level of ecosystem service in terms of yield increase and monetary value as a function of landscape diversity and crop management. Farmer surveys will be carried out to document farmer behaviour with regard to pest management strategies and analyse the driving factors. These surveys will provide data for quantitative economic analyses of farmers’ responses. Farmer valuation of ES will be contrasted to the empirically-based model calculations. We will determine how policies may be used to restore ecosystem services, increase yields, enhance farmer income, and reduce farmer exposure to pesticides.

PLH,"VAN DER WERF, Wopke",,Dutch Science Foundation Tipping the system: the difficult transition from chemical towards,"natural pest control in agriculture Insecticides are used intensively for agricultural pest management, despite decades-long efforts to diminish pesticide dependency. We hypothesize that the transition to a more pesticide-independent agriculture is difficult to achieve because a pesticide-dependent agriculture suppresses beneficial biota that are needed for the transition to a pesticide-free agriculture, causing a “lock-in”. We further hypothesize that the pest management may be characterized as a dynamic system with alternative stable states. One stable state is characterized by dependency on insecticides and absence of effective populations of natural enemies. The other stable state is characterized by low or non-use of insecticides and presence of effective populations of natural enemies, suppressing pests. Each stable state is self- reinforcing due to positive feedback, and the transition from one state to the other is characterized by “tipping points”: critical points in the management intensity where the system switches from one stable state to the other. Moving to the pesticide-independent state requires a recovery process for which spatial and temporal scales have not been well characterized and may be landscape context specific. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of literature data, ecological modelling, farmer survey, and a field study at the landscape scale to test above hypotheses. We aim to establish under which set of conditions a coordinated effort between stakeholders has potential to “tip” the pest control system to an insecticide-independent state. This multi- disciplinary research will provide critically needed insight in the system dynamics underlying farmers’ pest control practices, and elucidate key principles governing a transition towards sustainable pest management.",2015-11,now,2015-11-23,PLH_doi_018.pdf

We study the mechanisms of action and regulation of nutritional factors in situations of inflammation and infection. Our hypotheses are that new nutritional components (mainly issued from breast milk) could influence: (i) the immune system (gene expression) early in life and prevent and/or modulate inflammatory diseases later in life, (ii) the course of inflammatory and/or infectious disease as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis. Our aim is to understand at different periods of prenatal and postnatal development the mechanisms by which nutritional components can influence future health and prevent/treat inflammatory diseases.
