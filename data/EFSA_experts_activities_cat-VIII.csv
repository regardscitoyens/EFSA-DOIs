NKVet aims are to promote increased veterinary research cooperation between veterinarians and researchers within the Nordic countries by organising meetings on topics within veterinary sciences relevant for a broad Nordic audience. NKVet is administered by a Board consisting of nine members, one from Iceland and two from each of the other Nordic countries. The Board members are nominated among employees at the veterinary universities and national veterinary institutes, and elected by their respective national veterinary associations. The work they perform for the NKVet is based on voluntary work and no compensation, except travel expenses to board meetings, is paid by the NKVet. The Board meets twice a year, normally in conjunction with the annual symposia. A Finnish member of NKVet board since October 2013",2013-10,now,2015-04-22,AHAW_doi_014.pdf
