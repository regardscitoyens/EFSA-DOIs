Our vision •To integrate, coordinate and disseminate research that will be influential in informing policy and practice and will support food security goals •To raise the profile of the food security challenge, providing leadership and coordinating our efforts •To be dynamic in identifying and responding to current and future challenges, leveraging existing funding, and co-designing new multidisciplinary research programmes •To encourage innovation •To help to translate existing knowledge in to practice •To provide a focus for UK contributions to wider international efforts",2013-02,now,2015-07-28,GMO_doi_006.pdf

Member of a scientific advisory entity,,VDI (Verein deutscher Ingenieure; Association of German Engineers),"I was the head of a working group (""Fachausschuss"") on ""Molecular ecology - Effects of GMO on soils"". This was an activity that had been initiated by the VDI to develop a recommendation how to measure the concentration of recombinant Bt-toxins from GM plants after a field release. My task was to invite experts and discuss the best methods and develop a suggestions for a method that can be applied for monitoring purposes. This activity was finished by spring 2009. The other activity of the group, which was finished in April 2012, was to discuss the sense and possible protocols to extract total DNA from soils in order to characterize the soil microbial diversity as a parameter for soil quality. The meetings of the group was not financially supported, each member had to find own traveling support and there were not payments or interests involved. There were one or two meetings per year, in total approx. 10 half day meetings. The total time dedicated to this task during the six years was about two hours per months. My personal motivation was to discuss with other experts possibilities to apply methods developed mainly for basic research to environmental risk assessment. There was no objective or intention in relation to GMO applications and guidelines. - I am not a member of the VDI but acted as an independent invited scientist only for the temporarily limited task mentioned here.

I supervise its work and participates in the discussions and interpretation of the results obtained, in line with the description of work included in the contract signed with the COM. which I had contributed to elaborate. In terms of experimental work the Food Allergy Laboratory is involved in WP 2 (i.e. Alternative in vitro testing approach for GMO food/feed) but also indirectly in WP 1 (90 Day feeding trials) to develop digestibility testing on plant/feed materials and immunological and metabolomic studies on animal samples. I am still personally involved in desk works of WP 3, i. e. “Review of the food/feed safety and health impacts of GM Plants” and in particular to prepare a systematic review on “The risk of allergic sensitization and elicitation in humans and animals exposed to an allergenic plant that has been genetically modified as compared to individuals exposed to the non-genetically-modified plant counterpart”.",2012-06,2013-05,2015-09-29,GMO_doi_017.pdf
"WAL, Jean-Michel",VI. Research funding,,EC DG Research,"FP7 Large RTD Project iFAAM : Integrated Approaches to Food Allergen and Allergy Risk Management (2012-2015). As indicated in Section IV (Employment) I have been involved in this project as Head of the Food Allergy Laboratory and INRA responsible scientist until 15 April 2013. I was WP leader for WP 8, i.e. “Clinically relevant allergen analysis” which includes the assessment of the ability of multianalyte tools to effectively measure clinically-relevant allergens in foods and the impact of the food matrix on the detection of allergens and also its influence on the bioavailability of allergens during digestion and on their allergenic activity. Since then I have no more executive responsibility in this project in which my former Group is still participant. I supervise the experimental work done and participates in the discussions and interpretation of the results obtained, in line with the description of work included in the contract signed with the COM. which I had contributed to elaborate. In addition, I am still personally involved in desk works within WP 10 to prepare collaborative overarching reviews with Clinicians, Consumers, Food Technologists, Regulators, Psychologists, etc … A state of the art paper on Precautionary allergen labelling, has been published in Allergy, i.e. Dunngalvin A, Alldrick A, Chan Ch, Crevel R, Grimshaw K, Schnadt S, Taylor S, Turner P, Allen KJ, Austin M, Baka A, Baumgartner S, Bucchini L, Fernández Rivas M, Grinter K, Houben G, Hourihane J, Kruizinga A, Lack G, Madsen CB, Mills C, Papadopoulos NG Poms R, Regent L, Sherlock R, Wal JM, Roberts G.

"WAL, Jean-Michel",VI. Research funding,,EC DG Research,"FP7 Coordinated Action MARLON : Monitoring of Animals for Feed- related Risks in the Long Term. Assessing post-market monitoring of potential health impacts of GM-crops in livestock (2012-2015). With the same introductory remark as for the GRACE project, I am involved in WP 2 and WP 3. WP 2 (GM feed consumption measurements) explores the possibilities to measure exposure to GM animal feeds in an individual animal or groups of animals based on detection of GM material in physiological samples of these animals. WP 3 (defining animal health indicators) investigates on the definition of specific sensitive health indicators for the purpose of monitoring potential health effects, including allergenicity / immunotoxicity, that are related to consumption of GM crops.",2012-06,2013-05,2015-09-29,GMO_doi_017.pdf
