"EDLER, Lutz",V. Occasional consultancy,,"Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (German Cancer Research Center), DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany, Stiftung des Öffentlichen Rechts der Bundesrepublik Deutschland","Consultancy of projects at the Department of Biostatistics of the German Cancer Research Center which started before end of regular employment in February 2010 and which had not been finished by that time or which were extended by the collaborators afterwards. The number of such ongoing or re-opened projects has been since February 2010 less than five and requires work forf 2-5 meetings per year. The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) is a Foundation of Public Law located in Im Neuenheimer Feld 280 | 69120 Heidelberg Germany. The legal remit is to perform research on cancer and described in full detail in https://www.dkfz.de/de/dkfz/download/Satzung.pdf. The expert's role in the organization and his/her main tasks during the employment from 1979 to 2010 was to perform biostatistical research to support the centers remit by in the design and analysis of experimental and clinical studies of the research on cancer. The organisation does not make direkt use of the results of this work, except registering scientific puablication in its reports The work is restricted to give advice in design, evaluation of the data and publication of the results of biomedical studies related to cancer. The organisation has no official responsibility to carry out risk management and is exclusively engaged in the science risk assessment and evaluation related to the incidence and treatment of cancer. The work reported here concerns also Biostatistical research and application of mathematical and statistical methods in the 7th Framework Project BASELINE EU Grant Agreement No 222 738 in a part time contract of 12-34 h/months which ends in 2013 The BASELINE project's objective is to provide harmonised and validated sampling strategies, to support the European policies in food safety and to be suitable for food producers, in order to collect comparable data to improve quantitative risk analysis of selected biological and chemical agents. My work for the project is to support workpackage 6 (WP6) on Model Development by supportimg the WP 6 leader located at the DKFZ in the development of predictive mathematical models for biological risks and investigate and model sources and pathways of chemical contaminants to improve sampling schemes. This is obtained by a review of existing and definition of new mathematical models in predictive microbiology; investigation of correlations between food risk factors and traceable environmental parameters and contamination indicators; consolidation of existing and new models for microbial growth as a function of intrinsic environmental factors and extrinsic parameters. This refers to the previous work for the project done in the function as previous Department Head and previous WP 6 Leader which ended by retirement from the DKFZ in 2010 reported under VI.

"PETERSEN, Annette",IV. Employment,,"Technical University of Denmark, National Food Institute","The Technical University (DTU) has the following main objectives: education, research, public sector consultancy and innovation. DTU does not participate in development of pesticides in view of their authorisation. DTU does not perform risk management but as stated below we perform research based scientific advising and risk assessment which can be used by the Danish authorities in risk management and decision making. DTU has not developed or published risk assessment guidance or methodologies that are used in the regulatory process of pesticides. For pesticides we use the EFSA PRIMo model for intake calculations and comparison with ADI and ARfD. My main usual tasks are: - Performing research based scientific advising of the National Food Agency about exposure and risk assessment of contaminants and pesticides. - Perform research based advising of the Danish authorities as part of national authorisations for pesticides and before meetings in Codex and EU. - Research within probabilistic modelling. Have been granted access to the programme MCRA (developed by RIVM and Biometris in the Netherlands) so this programme is used for probabilistic calculations. - Teaching at DTU and University of Copenhagen in chemical risk assessment and exposure of contaminants including cumulative and probabilistic modelling. - Teaching in setting maximum limits for contaminants and pesticides. - Preparing Evaluation reports to and MRL proposals for some of the pesticides where Denmark is Rapporteur Member State (RMS). - Preparing evaluation reports for the Northern zone for some of the pesticides where Denmark is RMS. Funding is as a starting point from public money coming from the governmental funding of the University. For some work concerning evaluations of pesticides applicants pay a fee to the authorities and part of this fee is paid to DTU for performing the work. Teaching as part of external projects: - Has done teaching in Chemical Risk Assessment in the EU project Better Training for Safer Food in the period spring 2011 untill now. - Have performed teaching in chemical Risk Assessment in Ghana, Ethiopia and Botswana as part of the EU project EDES from November 2012 to March 2014. The project continues until summer 2015. - Teaching in Chemical Risk Assessment in Saudi Arabia in 2012 as part of an agreement between DTU and the Saudi Arabian authorities. - Teashing in the course arranged and finansed by EFSA ""Training seminars on risk assessment for Pre-Accession countries in 2013 - chemical"" in July 2013.

From 1 April 2015, Fera moves from being a wholly-owned agency of UK Government (Defra) to Fera Science Limited, a joint venture between Capita (75% shareholding) and Defra (25% shareholding). This new arrangement means that Fera Science Limited will be legally classified as private sector overall, but will continue to provide independent evidence/advice to UK government as well as commercial services. Following discussions between Fera, FSA with EFSA, it has been agreed that the EFSA Management Board will consider an application from Fera Science Limited for continuation of Article 36 (and so Food Safety Organisation) status, on the grounds that the funding profile for Fera Science Ltd will be dominated by public sector funding, at least in the medium term. EFSA has advised that until the EFSA Management Board reaches a decision in June, Fera Science Limited will retain its current status with EFSA as a Food Safety Organisation, and would not anticipate any consequent changes in the eligibility of Fera staff to serve on EFSA committees. Fera has no official responsibility for food chemical risk management. My own role is to lead a team of scientific staff investigating environmental contaminants in food and their impact on human health. These include dioxins and PCBs (both dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCBs), PAHs, trace elements, flame retardants such as PBDEs, TBBPA, HBCDD, organo-phosphorus compounds such as PFOS and the like, brominated and mixed halogenated dioxins, PCNs and other emerging contaminants in foods.",1988-05,now,2015-05-01,CONTAM_doi_015.pdf
