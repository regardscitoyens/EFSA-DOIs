"BROCK, Theodorus",IV. Employment,,"Alterra, Wageningen University and Research Centre","Senior Research Scientist Aquatic Ecology and Ecotoxicology of the ERA team of Alterra. Alterra is a non for profit organisation and research institute under the umbrella of Wageningen University and Research Centre. Its pupose is to conduct independent applied scientific research in the field of environmental sciences. In 2014, 44% of the funding of Alterra was provided by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, 16% by other Dutch ministries and other Dutch governmental organizations, 13% by the European Union, 18% by the private sector, and 8% by other funds (e.g. FAO, CEFIC, science foundations) The ERA team of Alterra conducts scientific research and develops scientific methods related to the risk assessment of pesticides. Alterra as an organization has not developed and published RA guidance or methodologies used in the regulatory process but Alterra scientists (including myself) have developed and published methodologies and proposals for decision trees in the ERA of pesticides in co-operation with scientists from other institutes inside and outside the Netherlands. Alterra owns a suite of software and computational models that are used in the regulatory process in the Netherlands and at the EU level (including GeoPEARL, PEARL, TOXSWA, TOP_RICE, SWASH, DROPLET, MASTEP). Most of these tools are available via internet (always free of charge). Part of these models are co-owned by the Dutch research institutes RIVM and PBL (e.g. GeoPEARL and PEARL). I was not directly involved in the development of these models. Alterra gives advice on scientific aspects of the risk assessment procedure to Dutch Ministries, regulatory authorities (e.g. Ctgb, the Dutch Board for the Registration of Pesticides and Biocides) and Agrochemical companies on an independent basis, and against funding. In addition, Alterra performs higher-tier micro-/mesocosm experiments under GLP. On behalf of Alterra I played a role in the co-ordination of the governmental funded research on ERA procedures for pesticides (BO- 20-002) from mid 2014 to 1 June 1015. I am not involved in any national or international regulatory body as a representative of my organization or my country.",1991-06,now,2015-10-23,SCOM_doi_001.pdf
"BROCK, Theodorus",IV. Employment,,"Wageningen University and Research Centre, NETHERLANDS","The last 5 years, as an employee of Alterra (Wageningen University and Research Centre), I provided advice on how to interpret higher-tier toxicity data for the Dutch Board for the Registration of Biocides and Pesticides (Ctgb) and the chemical industry. This activity mainly concerns the interpretation of complex microcosm/mesocosm tests (performed by other institutes) and the writing of independent expert opinions on the exposure-response relationships that can be derived from these semi-field studies. These independent expert opinions are often required by regulatory authorities. On behalf of Alterra, and to support its internal quality assurance system, I act as internal reviewer of test protocols and final reports of semi-field experiments performed by Alterra under GLP and financed by the chemical industry and used for the registration procedure for pesticides. The goal of this internal quality assurance system is to critically review the scientific reports of studies (before their official publication) by an internal employee of Alterra not directly involved in these studies. On an annual basis approximately 100 h of my time is involved in these activities directly or indirectly funded by industry to Alterra. This activity does not concern financial compensation in my individual capacity.",1991-06,now,2015-10-23,SCOM_doi_001.pdf

The work reported here concerns also Biostatistical research and application of mathematical and statistical methods in the 7th Framework Project BASELINE EU Grant Agreement No 222 738 in a part time contract of 12-34 h/months which ends in 2013 The BASELINE project's objective is to provide harmonised and validated sampling strategies, to support the European policies in food safety and to be suitable for food producers, in order to collect comparable data to improve quantitative risk analysis of selected biological and chemical agents. My work for the project is to support workpackage 6 (WP6) on Model Development by supportimg the WP 6 leader located at the DKFZ in the development of predictive mathematical models for biological risks and investigate and model sources and pathways of chemical contaminants to improve sampling schemes. This is obtained by a review of existing and definition of new mathematical models in predictive microbiology; investigation of correlations between food risk factors and traceable environmental parameters and contamination indicators; consolidation of existing and new models for microbial growth as a function of intrinsic environmental factors and extrinsic parameters. This refers to the previous work for the project done in the function as previous Department Head and previous WP 6 Leader which ended by retirement from the DKFZ in 2010 reported under VI.

Wageningen-UR supports the government in the implementation of laws and regulations that are needed for safe foods and healthy animals, and to guarantee a sustainable environment. This is set out in an agreement called the WOT Statute. The RIKILT-Institute of Food Safety has been commissioned to perform tasks under the program WOT 02 Food Safety by the minister of Economic Affairs and its executive organisation NVWA. The minister of Economic Affairs has specified a number of additional requirements to the execution of the statutory research tasks which RIKILT has been commissioned to conduct. In my role of chair the advisory entity has to judge whether the statutory research is carried out in an independent, reliable and transparant manner. Thereto, twice a year (half day meeting) the advisory committee reviews the workplans in the following year and evaluates the progress of the ongoing year (including an assessment report on output, management and outcome).
