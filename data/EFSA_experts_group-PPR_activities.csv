"ADRIAANSE, Paulien",IV. Employment,,Alterra Wageningen UR,"Senior research scientist Behaviour of pesticides in surface waters, Alterra is a not for profit organisation and research institute which is part of Wageningen University and Research Centre. Its purpose is to conduct independent applied scientific research in the field of environmental sciences. In 2014, 44% of the funding of Alterra was provided by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, 11% by other Dutch ministries and Dutch provinces, 13% by the European Union, 6% by Water Boards and other local governmental organisations, 18% by the private sector and 8% by other organisations or entities. The ERA team of Alterra conducts scientific research and develops scientific methods related to the risk assessment of pesticides. Alterra as an organisation has not developed and published RA guidance or methodologies used in the regulatory process, but Alterra scientists (including myself) have developed and published methodologies and proposals for decision trees in the ERA of pesticides in co-operation with scientists from other institutes inside and outside the Netherlands. Alterra owns a suite of software and computational models that are used in the regulatory process in the Netherlands, the EU level and elsewhere in the world (including GeoPEARL, PEARL, TOXSWA, Top_Rice, DROPLET, MASTEP and PRIMET). Most of these tools are available via internet (always free of charge). part of these models are co-owned by the Dutch research institutes RIVM and PBL (e.g. GeoPEARL and PEARL). I was or am directly involved in the development of several models, e.g. TOXSWA, SWASH, DROPLET, Top_Rice and PRIMET. Alterra gives advice on scientific aspects of the risk assessment procedure to Dutch Ministries, regulatory authorities (e.g. the Ctgb, the Dutch Board for the Authorisation of Plant protection Products and Biocides) and agrochemical companies on an independent basis, and against funding. In addition, Alterra performs higher-tier micro- /mesocosm experiments under GLP.

It was established by the French government in 2005 to fund research projects, based on competitive schemes giving researchers the best opportunities to realize their projects and paving the way for ground-breaking new knowledge. The role of the Agency is to bring more flexibility to the French research system, foster new dynamics and devise cutting edge- strategies for acquiring new knowledge. By identifying priority areas and fostering private-public collaborations, it also aims at enhancing the general level of competitiveness of both the French research system and the French economy. Project-based research funding is known to stimulate research organisations and strengthen their synergies. The ANR’s approach to funding allows French research to reinforce its international position and better integrate the framework of European cooperation. ANR funds are available in all scientific fields, for both fundamental and industrial research and for public research organisations as well as private companies (through public/private partnerships). With a peer review process matching the highest international standards, ANR’s general goal is to fund excellent research, while also facilitating innovation and interdisciplinary work and developing European and international collaborations. The ANR is constantly attentive to the scientific community. Indeed, consulting the scientific community each year on the future needs in both fundamental and applied research is one of the agency’s priorities. The ANR’s goal is to identify themes which can respond not only to societal, environmental and economic needs, but also to technological and scientific challenges, through a broad consultation process. In order to enrich its portfolio of thematic programmes with the most strategic considerations, the Agency therefore implements a continuous foresight and programme planning process in which it consults the widest possible range of national and international stakeholders. ANR's programmes are organised in 6 thematic priorities: •Environment and Biological Resources •Engineering, Processes and Security •Health and Biology •Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies •Sustainable Energy •Social Sciences and Humanities Since July 2010, ANR's programme planning and selection processes are ISO 9001 certified.",2011-03,2014-04,2015-04-18,PPR_doi_003.pdf

"KLEIN, Michael",IV. Employment,,Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME),"Current position: senior scientist working for the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft at the Fraunhofer IME. Fraunhofer is Europe’s largest application-oriented research organisation organised in 67 institutes. The research efforts are geared entirely to people’s needs: health, security, communication, energy and the environment. In 2013 the total budget of Fraunhofer was 1661 M€. 1083 M€ was based on public money and 578 M€ based on industry resources (see http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/facts- and-figures/finances/contract-research-revenue-2009-2013.html). The industry money from the pesticide industry is insignificant when related to the whole Fraunhofer budget. I work at the Fraunhofer IME which undertakes applied research of direct utility to private and public enterprise and of wide benefit to society (mission). In 2014 the private fundig of the Fraunhofer IME summed up to 44.5 % (see http://www.ime.fraunhofer.de/en/about_us/institute_data.html). In 2014 my personal fraction of industry work was about 17%. I spend all my office time for IME-activities. The time I spend for attending meetings of the BfR-Commission the IME-activity only covers 2 %. Due to this mission the Fraunhofer IME is doing studies for authorities (e.g. UBA), but also for the pesticide industry to be used in the regulatory risk assessment. However, as a research institute Fraunhofer IME does not do any decisions on regulatory risk assessment or risk management. IME is also not doing pesticide research in the meaning of development of new pesticides. Instead, pesticide risk research is important at the Fraunhofer IME. This research is generally financed with public money. I am involved in this research which is usually not related to individual compounds but to processes and principles. Some examples for pesticide risk research at the IME (all funded with public money) are: Validation of FOCUS PELMO for a reliable prediction of the leaching potential of PPP into groundwater in Germany, Geodata based Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Plant Protection Products (GEORISK), Development of German FOCUS type run-off and drainage scenarios, endocrine disruption in invertebrates (GERDA) - reproduction test using aquatic snails, concept development for extended plant testing of veterinary medicinal products, participation in the development and OECD validation of fish tests for endocrine disruption and biomagnification, hepatocyte assay to predict the bioaccumulation of chemicals in fish, development of a dietary burden calculator for fish metabolism studies, estimation of reasonable application dates related to crop development, Fish Full Life Cycle Test protocol development, chronic effects after peak vs. flow-through exposure. The fraction of industry funding in the area of pesticide risk research at the IME is negligible. However, IME is involved in the provision of experimental studies used for regulatory risk assessment. These fate and effect studies are always studies on specific pesticides or products performed according to guidelines. A substantial fraction of the total industry money at the IME is based on these studies (36 % in 2012 and 2013). I am not involved in any of these experimental studies and have no overview what is actually analysed in the institute. (continued, please find part 2)",1987-06,now,2015-04-17,PPR_doi_007.pdf

"LASKOWSKI, Ryszard",IV. Employment,,"Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiellonian University","Legal remit: Research and teaching. The organization does NOT participate directly in pesticide authorization, however results of our research projects in the area of ecotoxicology may be used for such purposes. The organization is NOT involved in regulatory assessment of pesticides. The organization has NOT developed and published any RA guidance or methodologies used in regulatory process (unless some of our results have been used without our knowledge). The organization is NOT the owner of software, etc., used in regulatory process. The organization is has NOT official capacity of Risk Management. My position and tasks: Professor, Head of the Ecotoxicology and Stress Ecology Research Group; main duties: leading research projects funded by national and international granting bodies, supervising graduate and PhD students, teaching regular university courses (e.g., Ecology, Ecotoxicology and ERA, Tropical Ecology). Appointing researchers and technical staff; supervising laboratory of ecotoxicology; heading the Institute Committee for Researchers Career. Detailed description of research activities: 1. All research conducted by my team is of purely scientific nature. However, as we are the ""ecotoxicology team"", our scientific activities cover research on various types of toxic chemicals, ranging from heavy metals (most of our work) through pesticides, detergents, PAHs, etc. 2. The chemicals used in our research are selected for solving particular scientific questions. So far, we used a rather limited set of pesticides (imidacloprid, dimethoate) and a few PAHs. I am not aware of any direct use of our results in registration dossiers. 3. Increasing the scientific knowledge is the core of our activity, apart from teaching. Results are published in international scientific journals. Some of the articles are aimed specifically on improving ecological risk assessment and, possibly, registration of chemicals but none of the projects completed by my team was directly connected to such activities. Examples of the articles discussing current ERA weaknesses can be found in my publication list (see esp.: (a) Van Gestel et al. (Eds) 2010.

The aim of the advisory board is to judge the scientific quality of the project proposals and their results. I have only an advisory function, so I don't have the right to vote. The amount of time required for this working group was approximately 10 days/year. I do not receive financial compensation for this WG.",2014-11,now,2015-04-17,PPR_doi_018.pdf
"TIKTAK, Aaldrik",IV. Employment,,PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency,"The remit of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) is indepedent scientic assessment of national environmental policies. PBL works for the Dutch government, but has an independent scientific position. With respect to plant protection products, PBL has recently evaluated the environmental and socio-economic effects of the Dutch Policy Plan for Sustainable Plant Protection. The end-report of this evaluation has been published in Janurary 2012. As mentioned above, PBL is an independent body working mainly on a self-tasking basis (steered in a way that has much in common with the way EFSA is working). So, we EVALUATE environmental policy, but are NOT involved in the decision making process (risk-management). Our independent position also means that we are not allowed to work for NGO's or industry, so private funding is zero. PBL is therefore not involved in the development of pesticides or in the authorisation procedure of pesticides. Our independent position also means that we do not publish regulatory guidance. We are giving, however, scientific input to the development of such guidance, see activities III - Member of Scientic Advisory Body). One of the scientific inputs to guidance development, is the development of the model(s) that support such guidance. PBL is therefore involved in the development of PEARL and GeoPEARL, because this is seen as a scientific input. PBL is also owner (together with RIVM and Alterra) of these models. Within PBL, I am employed as a Senior Researcher Soil and Water. My main tasks are: (i) to coordinate the development and use of enviornmental fate models (pesticides, nutrients and other contaminants),(ii) to evaluate national environmental policy (pesticides, nutrients, soil), and (iii) give scientific input to the development of guidance for registration of pesticides (surface water, groundwater and soil). With respect to pesticides, I am responsible for development and use of the PEARL and GeoPEARL models (used for Dutch and European pesticide risk assessment and policy evaluation). This acitivity is funded by the Dutch government and carried out in co-operation with Alterra and RIVM. The decision for use of PEARL for European registration is steered by the EFSA version control group. The decision for use of PEARL for Dutch authorisation is controlled by the Dutch Ministries of Infrastructure and Environment (IenM) and Economic Affair (EZ). I am further responsible for the evaluation of the Dutch Environmental Policy (see above).",1991-11,now,2015-04-17,PPR_doi_018.pdf

Employment,,"RIVM, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, NETHERLANDS, Bilthoven","As employee of RIVM I have been involved in the evaluation of pesticides and biocides for the purpose of authorization and regulation in the Netherlands or in the EU. Since 2002 I have been involved in JMPR as a temporary advisor and in 2011 and 2013 as a temporary advisor for JECFA. Role: evaluation of toxicological studies of, among others, pesticides and biocides, and drafting proposals for human health limit values (ADI, ARfD, AOEL, AEL). Since 2012 I have prepared advices for the risk managers at the Ministry of Health concerning environmental and process contaminants in the preparation for the DG SANCO expert committee meetings on this subject in Brussels. I have participated in these meetings in an advisory role to the representative of the Dutch ministry of Public Health. The principal task of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) is to support the Dutch government in formulating its policy, by collecting and integrating knowledge worldwide and to conduct research where needed. RIVM is funded only by public money. The Act on the RIVM of 1996 stipulates that commissioning bodies will not have any influence on the organization and outcome of RIVM’s activities. RIVM is the official research facility for the ministries of ""Health Welfare and Sports"" and ""Infrastructure and the Environment"" in the Netherlands, and serves the Inspectorate for Public Health. RIVM also works for the ministries of ""Economic affairs, Agriculture, and Innovation"" and for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). RIVM is contracted by the Dutch Board for the Authorization of Pesticides and Biocides (Ctgb) to evaluate dossiers. RIVM has no vote in the authorisation of pesticides as such. RIVM has developed and published guidance or methodologies used in the regulatory process of pesticide authorisation and residue limits, and developed calculation tools and models in order to be transparant how proposed methodology is used. All programs have been paid for by public money and are available on a non-commercial basis. For dietary risk assessment: • MCRA: Monte Carlo Risk Assessment, developed for RIVM by WUR/Biometris [https://mcra.rivm.nl]. • SPADE: tool for food consumption data analysis [www.wiv-isp.be/aph/pdf/APH68_S41.pdf]. • Version 03 Dutch TMDI_NEDIcalculation.xlt and Version 05 Dutch NESTI calculation.xlt: Excelfiles for Dutch chronic and acute dietary risk assessment [www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/320005006.pdf]. • RIVM and Wageningen University developed the IPRA-method to estimate which fraction of the population is affected by substances in food (Van der Voet H, Slob W (2007) Risk Anal 27 351-71). • ETX 2.0: A program (in Excel) to fit log-normal distributions [www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/601501028.pdf] • PROAST:analysis of toxicological dose-response data [http://www.rivm.nl/en/foodnutritionandwater/foodsafety/proast.jsp] • GeoPearl and PEARL: pesticide leaching models jointly developed by RIVM, Alterra Wageningen UR, and the Netherlands Environmental Agency (PBL).
