The mission of CEBAS-CSIC is, through its investigation, to contribute to generating the knowledge necessary to improve its competitiveness, developing strategies to attain the sustainability of the scant resources existing in semiarid areas through their correct management, and making possible a quality agriculture which produces healthy and safe plant food products. The singularity of CEBAS in that it is a multidisciplinary centre with three distinct areas of investigation (Agricultural Sciences, Food Science and Technology and Natural Resources), each of which operates separately but within a common context (CEBAS).",2004-12,now,2015-11-27,BIOHAZ_doi_000.pdf

Research funding,,"Spanish National Research Program, MINECO, Spanish Goberment","Research Project on: Quality and safety biomarkers of fresh-cut leafy greens The aim of this project will be to study different biomarkers as predicted tools to determine the impact of intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors realted with the quality and safety characteristics. The main expected result from the development of quality biomarkers will be the selection of cultivar genotipes, environmental conditions, agricultural practices, handling conditions, processing and storage practices that guarantee the quality maintenance of leafy greens. Meanwhile, The expected results from the development of safety biomarkers will be the establisment of microbial standards that will guarantee the safety of leafy greens as well as the prevention of potential microbial risk factors. The Safety Biomarkers included in this proposal will be: 1) Microbial indicators of faecal contamination. Correlation between enumeration of molecular E. coli as well as other novel microbial indicators (F-specific RNA phages, Enterococcus, etc.) with the prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms will be evaluated under different environmental conditions and agricultural practices. 2) Natural microbiota dynamic and their relationship with foodborne pathogens. Changes in the natural microbiota of phyllosphere that might affect the adhesion and survival of pathogenic bacterial will be evaluated. Interactions between bacterial populations in leafy greens will be determined and correlated with the prevalence of foodborne microoganisms.",2014-01,now,2015-11-27,BIOHAZ_doi_000.pdf
"ALLENDE, Ana",VI. Research funding,,"Center of Produce Safety (Davis, California, US)","Title: ""Demonstration of practical, effective and environmentally sustainable agricultural water treatments to achieve compliance with microbiological criteria"" Subject matter: ""The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate a practical, effective, and environmentally sustainable water disinfection treatment. Within this regard, the use of stabilized chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as a suitable disinfection treatment is proposed. We will try to establish if stabilized ClO2 could be a suitable disinfection treatment to assurance the compliance with the established microbial limits, particularly fecal indicator bacteria such as E. coli. First, agricultural waters from different water sources will be characterized by microbiological and physicochemical parameters. Optimal operational conditions for stabilized ClO2 as a suitable disinfection treatment will be established first at a pilot scale. After that, demonstration of practical, effective and environmentally sustainable agricultural water disinfection treatment will be carried out at commercial fields, where the impact of stabilized ClO2 on the environment will be also evaluated. We believe that the obtained conclusions will be very valuable for growers who will be able to integrate this technology in their water management practices"". The Center for Produce Safety (CPS), is a nonprofit public benefit corporation located in California with its principal place of business in 1477 Drew Avenue Davis, California. The CPS is a collaborative partnership that leverages the combined expertise of industry, government and the scientific and academic communities to focus on providing research needed to continually enhance food safety. This level of collaboration allows CPS to fill the knowledge gaps on produce food safety. CPS is largely a volunteer-run organization, with just three paid staff and minimal overhead. In 2014, CPS funded research projects in 9 states, from California to Massachusetts, from Michigan to Colorado. CPS was launched as a public-private partnership and is now international in scope with projects in 5 countries around the globe. This center does not depend on the UC Davies. The source of the fund is coming from both the public and the private sector.

"HERMAN, Lieve",III. Member of a scientific advisory entity,,Belgian federal agency for safety of the food chain,"The Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) lays down the operational standards applicable to businesses and integrates all official control and inspection services for the safety of the food chain (microbiological and chemical food safety), animal and plant diseases and animal welfare. The Scientific Committee consists of scientific experts who are independent from the Agency and are employed by universities and research centers in Belgium. The Committee is completely autonomous and is in charge of risk assessment. It gives its opinion on draft regulations and on the control plans. Moreover, it sees to it that the Food Agency work proactively. It must identify problems in time and report them to allow the Agency to take the measures that are required, e.g. providing for an adequate survey system. The Scientific Committee has strictly no relation with risk management issues. The Scientific Committee has no activity related to the QPS mandate of EFSA. As expert I am involved in all microbiological safety issues the scientific committee is dealing with e.g. the risk assessment of listeria in smoked salmon, the risk and benefit analysis of the consumption of raw milk. The work on the evaluation of raw cows milk was finished in 2011 and the work on the evaluation of raw milk from other animals than cows in 2013. Both evaluations were published as advices on the internet of the Food Safety Agency. During 2014 an evaluation on the risks of consumption of raw dairy products will start.
