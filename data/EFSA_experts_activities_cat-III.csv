The Scientific Committee consists of scientific experts who are independent from the Agency and are employed by universities and research centers in Belgium. The Committee is completely autonomous and is in charge of risk assessment. It gives its opinion on draft regulations and on the control plans. Moreover, it sees to it that the Food Agency work proactively. It must identify problems in time and report them to allow the Agency to take the measures that are required, e.g. providing for an adequate survey system. The Scientific Committee has strictly no relation with risk management issues. The Scientific Committee has no activity related to the QPS mandate of EFSA. As expert I am involved in all microbiological safety issues the scientific committee is dealing with e.g. the risk assessment of listeria in smoked salmon, the risk and benefit analysis of the consumption of raw milk. The work on the evaluation of raw cows milk was finished in 2011 and the work on the evaluation of raw milk from other animals than cows in 2013. Both evaluations were published as advices on the internet of the Food Safety Agency. During 2014 an evaluation on the risks of consumption of raw dairy products will start. Risk assessment of genetically modified organisms does not belong to the tasks of the Food Agency and its scientific committee. Risk assessment of feed and food enzymes does not belong to the tasks of the Food agency and its scientific committee.

It was established by the French government in 2005 to fund research projects, based on competitive schemes giving researchers the best opportunities to realize their projects and paving the way for ground-breaking new knowledge. The role of the Agency is to bring more flexibility to the French research system, foster new dynamics and devise cutting edge- strategies for acquiring new knowledge. By identifying priority areas and fostering private-public collaborations, it also aims at enhancing the general level of competitiveness of both the French research system and the French economy. Project-based research funding is known to stimulate research organisations and strengthen their synergies. The ANR’s approach to funding allows French research to reinforce its international position and better integrate the framework of European cooperation. ANR funds are available in all scientific fields, for both fundamental and industrial research and for public research organisations as well as private companies (through public/private partnerships). With a peer review process matching the highest international standards, ANR’s general goal is to fund excellent research, while also facilitating innovation and interdisciplinary work and developing European and international collaborations. The ANR is constantly attentive to the scientific community. Indeed, consulting the scientific community each year on the future needs in both fundamental and applied research is one of the agency’s priorities. The ANR’s goal is to identify themes which can respond not only to societal, environmental and economic needs, but also to technological and scientific challenges, through a broad consultation process. In order to enrich its portfolio of thematic programmes with the most strategic considerations, the Agency therefore implements a continuous foresight and programme planning process in which it consults the widest possible range of national and international stakeholders. ANR's programmes are organised in 6 thematic priorities: •Environment and Biological Resources •Engineering, Processes and Security •Health and Biology •Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies •Sustainable Energy •Social Sciences and Humanities Since July 2010, ANR's programme planning and selection processes are ISO 9001 certified.",2011-03,2014-04,2015-04-18,PPR_doi_003.pdf
