Fera offered, in open competition, its R&D and analytical services to bodies such as its parent department Defra and to other UK and non-UK Government departments, industry world-wide, the EU Research programmes, and consumer organisations. This included research projects and the analysis of samples for food and feed additives, residues, chemical migrants from packaging, markers of authenticity, and contaminants of all sorts. I was a civil servant. My salary was fixed and I had no other paid employment, contracted work, or fee income of any kind. I was most reently a member of the Food Quality & Safety programme within Fera. This programme had approximately 120 staff members plus visiting workers and students.

I attended their first meetings, answered questions about EFSA’s own work in this area, contributed to the development of scientific approaches, and reported back to the EFSA WG on FCMs. The first ILSI-NIAS meeting was in October 2011 and I ceased my participation in that group in June 2012 once that preliminary work was completed. I subsequently was invited and attended a workshop organised by ILSI Europe and held on 2-4 April 2014, in Brussels. The draft NIAS document was sent to all participants in advance of that workshop and it was stated by the organisers that a peer-reviewed publication covering the discussions would be produced soon after the workshop.",2011-10,2014-04,2015-04-19,CEF_doi_001.pdf

The WP4 had 8 partners including a Facet Industry Group (FIG) that was comprised of 12 European Trade Associations that cover all the major food packaging materials except for glass. Fera’s participation in the FACET project was funded 75% by the European Commission, 15% by the FIG, and 10% by the UK Food Standards Agency. The FIG was a key partner in the FACET project since they provided information on packaging composition and usage which was key to being able to estimate consumer exposure.

FhG is financed by around two thirds by public finance and performs also research work for or with industrial partners. FhG employees are salaried according to the fare conditions for public servants. FhG can be qualified as a legal entity pursuing objectives which are of public interest and acting with the neutrality required. At Fraunhofer IVV my function is head of department 'Product Safety and Analytical Chemistry'. It is my responsibility to ensure appropriate scientific competence and analytical equipment available to carry out our scientific research activities in the area of analytical measurement, physico-chemical understanding and theoretical modeling of mass transport processes from one matrix (e.g. food contact materials) into the adjacent matrix (e.g. foods or food simulants). A large field of research within my department is on interactions between packaging materials and foods. We develop for instance new, alternative test procedures or new and better analytical methods or develop further our scientific understanding of mass transport processes through dedicated model studies. We are performing contract work for both public and private enterprises and undertake research projects for a wide benefit to society. Areas of contract work are: - Quality assurance of packed foods and consumer protection in relation to packaging materials. This includes investigations to identify and clarify sources and causes of technical problems related to the production and performance of food packagings. - Studies in the area of food safety related to innovative technologies such as in the area of recycling of food packaging plastics or the use of nanomaterials food packages. - Migration studies for compliance evaluation of food contact applications with regard to national, European and US FDA requirements - Determination of contaminants in foods - Development of analytical methods for the above purposes - Very rarely (~1 time per year) we overtake submission of a dossier to EFSA on a new FCM substance to be used by industry. - More frequently, in the area of recycled plastics for food contact we have prepared numerous dossiers for industry for submission to US- FDA as well as for evaluation by the EFSA. This is still ongoing but a largely reduced rate now. Finally, outside of my department, my institute undertakes applied research in the area of food packing material developments including also technological developments in the area of ‘active&intelligent’ packaging material. Potential conflicts of interest (CoI): I see a CoI with CEF Panel in the area of PET recycling: Considering the large number of dossiers on PET recycling we have prepared and filed to EFSA I have to declare here a general CoI. This refers to PET recycling only. In case of other polymer types I do not see a CoI. In case we have been involved in the preparation of a dossier from industry I will have a CoI, of course. However, this will be addressed always in the particular specific declaration of interest (SDoI). Regardless to that I emphasise that I am payed for my work by Fraunhofer according to public salary tariffs and that I do not receive any additional private or industrial payments for my work.",1987-10,now,2015-08-07,CEF_doi_005.pdf

It has no competence in toxicological evaluation. As an institution, measures are taken in case rules are violated, which reaches from informal communication up to confiscation of products. It is not my job to implement such measures, but to carry out analytical work to support the management decisions with data. I am head of the group with the technical competence in GC-based analysis. The main duty is the analysis of samples taken from the market and the development of new analytical methods. We also investigate subjects considered to be a potential problem and provide the competence in such matter for the decision to be taken. We also communicate with colleagues of other enforcement authorities to harmonize evaluation and measures. Main subjects dealt with in the past: - Chromatographic technology, particularly gas chromatography. - Adulteration of expensive edible oils, such as olive oils. - Mineral oil of various sources in foods, food packaging materials (printing inks, recycled fibers), human milk and body fat. - Saturated hydrocarbons as oligomers from polyolefins (POSH) - Migrants from food packaging materials, such as can coatings, plasticizers from gaskets of lids or toys, various components from paper and board, printing inks and varnishes. - Migration of cyclo-diBA from can coatings. - Acrylamide: sources, ways for mitigation primarily in potato products. - Components formed by raffination of edible oils and fats. - Safety evaluation of coatings applied to pipes for water supply in house installations. - Barrier against the migration from recycled paperboard: development of a method for measuring efficiency; evaluation of various polymers Occasionally samples are analyzed for industry against payment, e.g. for lid producers or for determining mineral oil in recycled board or food, but such work does not involve industry-financed research projects. The money is earned by the laboratory (state of Zurich). The scope is usually to support industry in developing solutions to problems brought up by us, particularly when no other laboratory is able to perform the analysis. We were involved as a partner of two projects of the German BMELV/BLE, the first of components in printing inks used for food contact materials, the second on substances getting in food contact from recycled board. Results were published on the website of the German BLE and in scientific journals. In 2011 and in 2013 the KLZH and the CVUA Stuttgart organized coordinated enforcement campaigns on the migration of plasticizers from the lids of glass jars into oils food. In particular we offered chemical analysis and evaluation of documentation for all MS, but left the management of the results to the MS.
