UCD CVERA staff work closely with national policy-makers, both in government and industry. Staff also contribute to training in veterinary medicine, both to undergraduates and postgraduate.

Since 2012 these research priorities have been : 1) development of diagnostic platforms that can be used on farms (on site diagnostics), 2) development of markers for robustness in animals, 3) gut health in chickens en 4) development of new diagnostics for antibiotic resistance. ad 1) aimed at production diseases in general, but the advise does not include specific diseases, because it is directed at the technique itself, it will certainly not include notifiable diseases (prohibited for AHS, task of CVI) and also does not include vector borne diseases and there is no plan to include them; ad 2) does not include specific diseases, longevity of cattle is the outcome parameter; ad 3) does also not include specific diseases, because here the challenge is to define a healthy gut (in contrast to gut diseases); ad 4) this aims at identifying new techniques that can more quickly (than bacterial culture) identify antimicrobial resistance in order to chose the right treatment more quickly. In my opinion there has been no overlap between this consultancy and my work for EFSA, neither as a panel member, nor as a member or chair of a WG. To phrase this specifically for the chairing: There has been no overlap with the mandate on Rift Valley Fever, AHS does not have any activity in this area nor is planning one. The consultancy also has never had any involvement with bovine TB. Moreover vector borne diseases have not and will not be part of the consultancy, because that is restricted to the topics listed above and will be for the coming year (by December 2015 the contract will be reevaluated or can be stopped).
