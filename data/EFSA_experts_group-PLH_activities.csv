Universitat Jaume I has a Research Institute of Pesticides and Water (IUPA). A working branch of this institute is the Laboratory of Pesticide Residue Analysis (LARP), created in 2004. LARP was designated by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (MAGRAMA) as the Laboratory of Reference in Spain for pesticide residue analysis for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Studies related to the establishment of maximum residue levels.

Employment,,Wageningen University,"Education and Research I am employed as associate professor at Wageningen University, Plant Sciences Department, Centre for Crop Systems Analysis, Crop & Weed Ecology Group. My job is described as 45% teaching, 45% research and 10% management. Wageningen University is one of the premier agricultural universities in the world. It is the only university in the Netherlands to focus specifically on the theme ‘healthy food and living environment’. The remit of the organization is research and teaching (BSc, MSc and PhD level) in its domain of expertise. By being part of ""Wageningen University and Research Centre"", Wageningen University is associated with institutes that carry out legal functions and risk assessments in the domain of food and environmental safety. My research is on quantitative agro-ecology in a wide sense. This research aims at developing insights and tools for sustainable and healthy cropping systems that optimize production, resource use efficiency, and natural pest regulation based on natural mechanisms, including biotic interactions and spatial processes. I conduct, for instance, research on biological control of insects with viruses, dispersal of beneficial insects at field and landscape scale, disease spread at landscape scale and beyond, intercropping for high productivity and sustainable land use, ecology and biological control of weeds, and much more. My main strength is on the interface of field- based experimental studies and mathematical modelling. My teaching involves BSc-, MSc- and PhD-level courses in Population and Systems Ecology, Agrobiodiversity, Mathematics and Statistics, and Ecological Modelling. An important part of research is conducted in the form of PhD research. I have a large international network of collaborators. I have no role in risk management, and am not personally empowered to validate/take risk management actions/decisions. My role in management includes membership of the management team of the group which means taking decisions with respect to financial management, human resources, and other operational or strategic affairs.

Research funding,,"Dutch Science Foundation, Netherlands, The Hague, NWO","Living landscapes: recognizing and strengthening the contribution of ecosystem services (biological control, pollination) to crop yields, food security and farmer income in China Living landscapes comprise a diversity of land uses, amongst which agriculture is of prime importance for providing food security and sustaining the livelihoods of rural people, but where other functions such as biodiversity conservation, water storage and recreation should be harmoniously combined. Living landscapes support communities of beneficial insects that suppress pests and pollinate crops, which is critical to the productivity and sustainability of agriculture. These valuable services have generally suffered from intensification of agriculture (e.g. pesticide use) and simplification of agricultural landscapes. Here, we propose to conduct the first comprehensive study in China on the relation between landscape diversity and biological pest suppression and pollination. We will study biological control of plant hoppers and other pests in rice over a gradient of landscapes from highly diverse to simplified. Measurements will be made in farmers’ fields to determine the ecological interactions and economical trade- offs between biological control and pesticides as principal strategies for pest management. We will also quantify the effect of natural pollination by bees on the yield of oilseed rape, as influenced by landscape factors and crop management. Models of pest population dynamics and crop-pest relationships will be developed to predict level of ecosystem service in terms of yield increase and monetary value as a function of landscape diversity and crop management. Farmer surveys will be carried out to document farmer behaviour with regard to pest management strategies and analyse the driving factors. These surveys will provide data for quantitative economic analyses of farmers’ responses. Farmer valuation of ES will be contrasted to the empirically-based model calculations. We will determine how policies may be used to restore ecosystem services, increase yields, enhance farmer income, and reduce farmer exposure to pesticides. The research package aims at strengthening the functional role of landscape and habitat management for sustainable agriculture and food security in China.",2013-12,now,2015-11-23,PLH_doi_018.pdf
"VAN DER WERF, Wopke",VI. Research funding,,Dutch Science Foundation Tipping the system: the difficult transition from chemical towards,"natural pest control in agriculture Insecticides are used intensively for agricultural pest management, despite decades-long efforts to diminish pesticide dependency. We hypothesize that the transition to a more pesticide-independent agriculture is difficult to achieve because a pesticide-dependent agriculture suppresses beneficial biota that are needed for the transition to a pesticide-free agriculture, causing a “lock-in”. We further hypothesize that the pest management may be characterized as a dynamic system with alternative stable states. One stable state is characterized by dependency on insecticides and absence of effective populations of natural enemies. The other stable state is characterized by low or non-use of insecticides and presence of effective populations of natural enemies, suppressing pests. Each stable state is self- reinforcing due to positive feedback, and the transition from one state to the other is characterized by “tipping points”: critical points in the management intensity where the system switches from one stable state to the other. Moving to the pesticide-independent state requires a recovery process for which spatial and temporal scales have not been well characterized and may be landscape context specific. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of literature data, ecological modelling, farmer survey, and a field study at the landscape scale to test above hypotheses. We aim to establish under which set of conditions a coordinated effort between stakeholders has potential to “tip” the pest control system to an insecticide-independent state. This multi- disciplinary research will provide critically needed insight in the system dynamics underlying farmers’ pest control practices, and elucidate key principles governing a transition towards sustainable pest management.",2015-11,now,2015-11-23,PLH_doi_018.pdf

Research funding,,European Commission (EC),"POnTE: Pest Organisms Threatening Europe EU agriculture and forestry are threatened by alien and native pests, as a consequence of (i) globalized trade of plants and plant products and (ii) re-emergence of pests and diseases aided by new production scenarios, host cultivars and climate change. POnTE investigates the genetics, biology, epidemiology, vector ecology and economic impacts of four pathosystems that threaten strategic crops and natural landscapes in the EU in order to identify economically, technically feasible and environmental sustainable integrated management strategies for the containment of each pathosystem. For each target, the research activities will implement the state-of-the-art and provide a novel scientific background to sustain future management policies. The specific objectives will broadly cover all targeted pathosystems merging multidisciplinary research with the practical needs of the stakeholders and end-users.
