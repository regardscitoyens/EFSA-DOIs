      "During the past ten years I have participated in several nationally or EU funded public projects. These projects typically have several partners, most of them from academia and research institutes and some from the industry. This research is pre-competetive in nature and doesn't involve work performed to a specific industrial partner. My role in these projects has always been related to microbiology: pro- and prebiotics for humans, safety of lactic acid bacteria for humans (including antibiotic resistance), microbiological safety of foods, and topics related to nutrition and human microbiota. Currently ongoing are projects related to food safety, nutrition, host and microbiota. Feed companies have not been involved in these public projects.",

In public Tekes projects Finnish food companies (including Valio Ltd., Raisio Plc, Finland; Oy Karl Fazer Ab, Finland; Oy Sinebrychoff Ab, Finland) have provided a nominal sum for funding of the pre- competetive research work performed at VTT (appr. 10 000 \u20ac/per year).",
