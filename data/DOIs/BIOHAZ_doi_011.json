In the last 5 years I have been involved in research projects which are funded internally via monies that the Veterinary School where work receives from the Education ministry in Norway (e.g. supervision of a PhD student researching canine giardiasis). I have been involved in projects funded by the Norwegian Research Council (as postodcotral researcher on project concerned with epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in Norway). I have been involved in research projects funded under EU 7th Framework Programme (e.g. task leader on 'veg-i-trade' (concerned with globalisation and pathogens on fresh produce), in which my task involved development of methods for analysing fresh produce for different protozoa of public health significance. I have been involved in research/educational projects funded by the Norwegian Centre for International Cooperation in Education. I am the scientific coordinator of a COST Action on foodborne parasites. This involves a range of participants from academia, institutes, and industry, and is designed to foster interactions between different groups with different expertise and knowledge. None of these activities are in a private capacity \u2013 the funds are received by my institute",
