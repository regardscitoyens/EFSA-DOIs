The TransMIT Society for Technology Transfer GmbH\u201d was founded by three central Hessian Universities to make the potentials of the universities accessible to academic and industrial partners. The focus lies currently on the fermentative production of pesticide metabolites and on investigations on the degradation of veterinary drugs in food and in the environment. Potential future activities may include sophisticated analyses of flavour compounds, enzymes and veterinary drugs; development and optimization of biotechnological processes; detection of off flavours and biotechnological synthesis of flavour compounds; consulting and training in the fields of enzyme technology and food safety. Gains are used for the centre only; no personal payments. Approximately two (one day) meetings per year.",
