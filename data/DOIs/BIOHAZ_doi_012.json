      "Without any economical compensation, I was asked by the European Commission (Dr- Plantady and coll.) to provide \"informal comments on the applications from Austra and Denmark (2013) and from Finland and Sweden (2014) to be recognised as having a classical scrapie negligible risk status. In particular help was requested in evaluating the requirement that: \u201cfor a period of at least seven years, a sufficient number of ovine and caprine animals over 18 months of age, representative of slaughtered, culled or found dead on farm, have been tested annually, to provide a 95 percent level of confidence of detecting classical scrapie if it is present in that population at a prevalence rate exceeding 0,1 percent and no case of classical scrapie has been reported during that period;\u201d The original request was: Would you be willing to provide us with informal comments on this specific point? The consultancy ended by January 2015. (note: as a country in the above field related to the organization (EU Commission\" I entered Italy as the EU is not in the list)",
