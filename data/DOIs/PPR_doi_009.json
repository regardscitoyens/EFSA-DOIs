      "Legal remit: Research and teaching. The organization does NOT participate directly in pesticide authorization, however results of our research projects in the area of ecotoxicology may be used for such purposes. The organization is NOT involved in regulatory assessment of pesticides. The organization has NOT developed and published any RA guidance or methodologies used in regulatory process (unless some of our results have been used without our knowledge). The organization is NOT the owner of software, etc., used in regulatory process. The organization is has NOT official capacity of Risk Management. My position and tasks: Professor, Head of the Ecotoxicology and Stress Ecology Research Group; main duties: leading research projects funded by national and international granting bodies, supervising graduate and PhD students, teaching regular university courses (e.g., Ecology, Ecotoxicology and ERA, Tropical Ecology). Appointing researchers and technical staff; supervising laboratory of ecotoxicology; heading the Institute Committee for Researchers Career. Detailed description of research activities: 1. All research conducted by my team is of purely scientific nature. However, as we are the \"ecotoxicology team\", our scientific activities cover research on various types of toxic chemicals, ranging from heavy metals (most of our work) through pesticides, detergents, PAHs, etc. 2. The chemicals used in our research are selected for solving particular scientific questions. So far, we used a rather limited set of pesticides (imidacloprid, dimethoate) and a few PAHs. I am not aware of any direct use of our results in registration dossiers. 3. Increasing the scientific knowledge is the core of our activity, apart from teaching. Results are published in international scientific journals. Some of the articles are aimed specifically on improving ecological risk assessment and, possibly, registration of chemicals but none of the projects completed by my team was directly connected to such activities. Examples of the articles discussing current ERA weaknesses can be found in my publication list (see esp.: (a) Van Gestel et al. (Eds) 2010. Mixture Toxicity: Linking Approaches from Ecological and Human Toxicology. CRC Press; (b) Kammenga & Laskowski (eds.) 2000. Demography in Ecotoxicology. John Wiley and Sons; (c) Laskowski at al. 2010. Interactions between toxic chemicals and natural environmental factors - A meta-analysis and case studies.

Project partners are some major PPP industries (BASF, Syngenta) and national regulatory bodies (France, UK, Sweden).
