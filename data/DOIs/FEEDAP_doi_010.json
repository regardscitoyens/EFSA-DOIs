      "The last 5 years I have worked on omega 3 fatty acids and their link with meat quality and obesity. In France, my research is mainly funded by public funds. As a Professor I receive money from the French Ministry of Agriculture (through INRA) and from the French Ministry of Education and Research (national public funds) My activity is related to feed additives (omega 3 fatty acids) and new raw materials in feed; I have worked in collaboration with The Ivory Coast on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in guinea pig nutrition; the last experiment was on the use of Euphorbia heterophylla in hen and rabbit nutrition (from 2009 to now); Euphorbia heterophylla has a very high amount of omega 3 fatty acids; it is a plant that people destroy in Africa because this plant grows in the cotton fields and absolutely everywhere; this is the first work on this plant used for animal nutrition. And it is a good opportunity for animal producers to use this plant to feed their animals; the main consequences are a decrease in cholesterol content and an increase in the omega 3 content in animal products (meat and eggs); this is important in a poor region; the farmers can sell their products at a high price becasuse they are healthy; I work with a teacher from the Institut National polytechnique Felix Houphouet Boigny in Ivory Coast. The animals are resred in Ivory Coast and all the analyses are made in my Lab, I also write the papers in English My research activity is with INRA I got PhD grants from Valorex (feed company specialist of linseed) in 2012 for a PhD that will be finished in june 2015 on the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids in animal nutrition, using the rat as a model. We have shown that omega 3 fatty acids are anti obesity and omega 6 fatty acids are pro obesity; I am the director of the PhD 15 000 euros /year for 3 years (salary of the student) This does not exceed the budget I manage because it is for the student salary; the lab received no money There will be a thesis and scientific papers in international Journals",
