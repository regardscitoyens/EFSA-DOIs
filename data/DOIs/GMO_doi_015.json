      "I was the head of a working group (\"Fachausschuss\") on \"Molecular ecology - Effects of GMO on soils\". This was an activity that had been initiated by the VDI to develop a recommendation how to measure the concentration of recombinant Bt-toxins from GM plants after a field release. My task was to invite experts and discuss the best methods and develop a suggestions for a method that can be applied for monitoring purposes. This activity was finished by spring 2009. The other activity of the group, which was finished in April 2012, was to discuss the sense and possible protocols to extract total DNA from soils in order to characterize the soil microbial diversity as a parameter for soil quality. The meetings of the group was not financially supported, each member had to find own traveling support and there were not payments or interests involved. There were one or two meetings per year, in total approx. 10 half day meetings. The total time dedicated to this task during the six years was about two hours per months. My personal motivation was to discuss with other experts possibilities to apply methods developed mainly for basic research to environmental risk assessment. There was no objective or intention in relation to GMO applications and guidelines. - I am not a member of the VDI but acted as an independent invited scientist only for the temporarily limited task mentioned here. Info on VDI: VDI The Association of German Engineers is a financially independent and politically unaffiliated, non- profit organization of 132,000 engineers and natural scientists. More than 13,000 of these members work for the VDI in an honorary capacity.",

      "I was an invited expert of Advisory Committee (\"Fachbeirat\") on \"Monitoring of ecological effects of genetically modified organisms\" - The committee discusses the need and best approaches for standardizing methods for monitor the ecological effects of genetically engineered plants in agriculture for the benefit of the people. There was no specific or personal interest in this activity. My role was to provide scientific expertise for questions related to microbiological analysis of soils and methods to determine soil quality. There was no financial compensation or payment in regard to participation. There was one half-day meeting per year, thus I attended in total six of these meetings. The total time dedicated to this activity was not significant, estimated to be not more than 4 hours each year. Expenses for participation were covered by my employee, the Federal Research Institute for Rural Areas, Forest and Fishery (vTI). I am not a member of the VDI and I had been invited because of my scientific expertise. A temporarily limited task.

Soils from different agricultural sites in Europe will be analyzed using next-generation high-throuput DNA-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics.
