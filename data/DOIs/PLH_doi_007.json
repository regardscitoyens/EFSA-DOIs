      "The permanent position hold at \u2018Universitat Jaume I\u2019 includes both teaching and research activities. Teaching activities are related to crop protection subjects included in graduate (Agricultural Engineering) and postgraduate (master and PhD) courses in Plant Production, such as Applied Entomology, Crop Protection, IPM (integrated pest management) programs. Research interests are focused on the following topics: (1) biology, ecology and population dynamics of insects and mites of economic importance, especially in citrus and palms, (2) tactics, systems and strategies of IPM of insects and mites, (3) use of biological control as the primary tactic to manage populations of significant pests. In addition, extension activities are provided voluntarily in pest identification and control recommendations to the agricultural community. Universitat Jaume I has a Research Institute of Pesticides and Water (IUPA). A working branch of this institute is the Laboratory of Pesticide Residue Analysis (LARP), created in 2004. LARP was designated by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (MAGRAMA) as the Laboratory of Reference in Spain for pesticide residue analysis for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Studies related to the establishment of maximum residue levels. I am not a member of this institute which is mainly devoted to the development of new analytical methods for the quantitative analyses of pesticide residues in different substrates.",
