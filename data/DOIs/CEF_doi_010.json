The tasks of this eWG are to: Identify needs and alternatives for the application of note 161 in the GSFA system. The current work has a focus on the application of the note for sweeteners. This note is heavily disputed because it undermines the intention of the GSFA. The working group was installed by the Codex Alimentarius Committee for Food Additives (CCFA). Purpose is to facilitate the CCFA work in their process of setting Maximum use levels of additives in food. I do not have a voting right.
