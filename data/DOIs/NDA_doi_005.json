      "The central task of the BfR is the scientific risk assessment of food, feed, substances and products as the basis for the consumer health protection activities of the federal government. The Institute does not have any monitoring duties. However, it is involved in a number of reporting and authorisation procedures. To ensure that it can carry out its assessments without being influenced by political, economic or social interests, the Institute is independent by virtue of the Act establishing BfR. Thus, a major task of the BfR is to voice an opinion on the potential risks from food, consumer articles and chemicals, and to offer scientific advice to the federal ministries for their policy decisions. The BfR cooperates with a number of national and international, governmental and non-governmental agencies (FAO, WHO, OECD, etc.). It is the national Focal Point of EFSA and a partner of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The expert is the head of the Unit \"Nutritional Risks, Allergies and Novel Foods\" within the Department of Food Safety at the BfR. The main task of the Unit is the nutritional-physiological/nutritional- medical assessment of nutrients and other substances with physiological action in conventional foods, including food supplements and fortified foods, dietetic foods, novel foods and novel food ingredients, and food from genetically modified organisms. In addition, the Unit addresses questions on selected food risks and allergies. Furthermore, the Unit prepares opinions on infant formula, follow-up formula and weaning food. Moreover, the expert is responsible for the secretariat of the \"BfR Committee for Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Novel Foods and Allergies\" which is attached to the Unit. Main areas of work and research include: Risk assessment of secondary plant ingredients and other substances with specific nutritional or physiological effects; scientific assessment concepts for micronutrients and other food ingredients.",

BfR cooperates with a number of national and international, governmental and non- governmental agencies (FAO, WHO, OECD, etc.) and is the national Focal Point of EFSA. BfR participates in the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides, not in development of pesticides in view of their authorisation. It does not have an official capacity of Risk Management of pesticides. Among others, the BfR has been involved in the toxicological assessment of imidacloprid within the context of Germany serving as rapporteur in the EU. Some members of BfR have developed (dietary or resident/bystander) exposure models for risk assessment, which have been used in the national plant protection product authorisation procedure and have been published in: -Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz 48 (2005): 84 ff; -J. Verbr. Lebensm. 2 (2007): 54 ff; -J. Verbr. Lebensm. 3 (2008): 272 ff. The expert has not been involved in development of the models. BfR does not have/own rights on guidance document, risk assessment methodologies, commercial software or computational models of potential use in regulatory assessment of pesticides. The expert has functioned as a senior scientific officer in the Unit Toxicology of Pesticides and Biocides and has been involved in: - Toxicological assessment of pesticides and biocides both on the EU level (implementation of Regulations (EC) 1107/2009 and (EU) 528/2012) and within the framework of national authorisation procedures; -Preparation of proposals for classification and labelling of active substances based on toxicological properties; -Participation in drawing up of guidance documents of the EU or OECD concerning toxicological hazard identification or risk assessment; -Participation in providing scientific advice on toxicological assessment of pesticides; - Presentation of the BfR position at scientific meetings. The expert has participated in development of concept proposals by the BfR concerning the assessment of substances with endocrine disrupting properties in a regulatory context. The expert has been involved in experimental research activities, which have been/are subject to internal (governmental) funding. All fundings are paid to the employer: -Characterisation of in vitro models for prediction of transplacental transport of xenobiotics (deliverable: Scientific publication); -Array-based analysis of endocrine-disrupting properties of selected pesticides in the low dose range in vitro (deliverables: Scientific publication, project report to Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV)) -Hepatotoxic combination effects of multiple pesticide residues in food (starting 2011; deliverables: Scientific publication, project report to BMELV).",
