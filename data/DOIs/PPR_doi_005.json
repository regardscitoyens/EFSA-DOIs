Special Government Employees (SGEs) are hired for three-year terms with consideration for renewal. I was interested in continuing to serve as a member of the Board, so I applied for extending my membership on the SRB for an additional three years in order to renewal my status as US EPA SGE. Thus, I had to complete the Confidential Financial Disclosure Form for SGEs serving on Federal Advisory Committees at the US EPA (EPA Form 3110-48). SGEs are generally used as advisory committee members, individual experts or consultants. This activity does not involve fees, unless I were again called upon. This means that I have shown my willingness to act as an expert in a new committee or to collaborate again with the Agency if called. However, at this time I have not been required to provide any other service. Members of Scientific Advisory Panels (SAP) provide advice, information and recommendations on pesticide-related issues regarding human health and the environment. The expected deliverables are meeting minutes that have to be written as part of the activities of the SAP.",
