      "I am Senior Researcher at Univeristy. I am responsible for the packaging laboratory devoted to research, teaching and contract work. These activities are all part of my job at the University. As leader of the packaging group I am responsible for promoting, preparing and conducting projects (scientific content only) under the scope of National, European or International programmes for financing the research activity. These projects are developed in cooperation with other R&D institutions (public or private). The laboratory also undertakes contract work for third part institutions and enterprises which I supervise as part of my job. This work consists typically on testing materials for global and specific migration to verify compliance with legislation. These companies are, to my knowledge, not submitting any authorisation application to EFSA. In case it comes to my knowledge that a specific work performed by the lab is being used in an application to EFSA, I will immediately declare that to EFSA and will undertake the necessary measures in order to be not involved on the evaluations in question, using the Specific Declaration of Interest procedure for each meeting. The laboratory may occasionally test packages to verify if the level of Bisphenol A complies with the limit laid down in Regulation (EU) 10/2011. This work is developed for food companies and packaging manufacturers, that want to verify the compliance of their packages. The laboratory acts as National Reference Laboratory for Food Contact Materials appointed by the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture Sea Environment and Territory and performs the testing required on behalf of Portuguese surveillance authorities. Within this scope, the lab performs measurements on samples collected by the authorities from the market. These tests focus always on already regulated substances. As part of my job I represent the laboratory at the meetings of European Network of National Reference Laboratories.",

      "The University is my employer and is a non-state University for Higher education and other public services. The University is financed through public grants (multi-annual financing plan), research projects and services provided to the community, including student\u2019s fees and tuitions in the scope of teaching and training programmes, and contract work to third party institutions and companies. The value of private funding does not exceed 10% approx. of the budget. All payments concerning research projects and contract work are always made to the University financial administration.
