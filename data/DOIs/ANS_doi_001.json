      "Within the framework of the OECD Test Guideline Programme, an expert group to review the set of OECD Test Guidelines on Genotoxicity has been established on July 2010. R.C has been appointed to participate as national expert. The working group is revising existing and newly proposed test guidelines, and will update the OECD introductory document on genetic toxicology testing and testing strategies. Testing strategies have also been recently reviewed by the EFSA working group on Genotoxicity testing strategies. It is noted that there is no overlap between the EFSA and scheduled OECD activities, because the EFSA opinion on testing startegies has already been finalized and published in 2011. No physical meeting are attended. Written comments forwarded through the National Coordinator (one-three for year) .",
