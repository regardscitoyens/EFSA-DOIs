Professor of Horticulture and Plant Disease Epidemiology with academic responsibilities for research and teaching, including PhD and graduate student supervision. The organisation has no official responsibilities for risk management, other than maintaining a 'risk register' for its internal academic activities. Following retirement in September 2010 continued an unremunerated affiliation with Imperial College as an Emeritus Professor in the Division of Ecology and Evolution with no academic responsibilities. In addition ad hoc inputs (uncosted) into research projects carried out by scientists in the Centre for Environmental Policy have been made. Activities have been: participation in a project meeting into projects on crop agroterrorism (EU framework 7-funded); provision of advice on \"equivalence\" in a project on compliance with plant health regulation in Asian countries (WTO-funded); and advice on environmental risk assessment for novel measures in malaria/mosquito control (Gates Foundation-funded); and pests and diseases of fruit crops (EU-funded). In recognition of these inputs a retainer as a Senior Research Investigator was made for 2012 (\u00a32000), 2013 (\u00a33000) and 2014 (\u00a33000) to cover associated expenses.",
