In principle, the commission cannot take regulatory decisions, but advice may be given on methodologies or on products. I am an ordinary member, not a chairman. However, I have the right to vote. The membership is not salaried. The activity covers 2 * 2 days per year including meetings. The time I spend for the Commission is paid by Fraunhofer as part of my regular salary.",

      "Current position: senior scientist working for the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft at the Fraunhofer IME. Fraunhofer is Europe\u2019s largest application-oriented research organisation organised in 67 institutes. The research efforts are geared entirely to people\u2019s needs: health, security, communication, energy and the environment. In 2013 the total budget of Fraunhofer was 1661 M\u20ac. 1083 M\u20ac was based on public money and 578 M\u20ac based on industry resources (see http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/facts- and-figures/finances/contract-research-revenue-2009-2013.html). The industry money from the pesticide industry is insignificant when related to the whole Fraunhofer budget. I work at the Fraunhofer IME which undertakes applied research of direct utility to private and public enterprise and of wide benefit to society (mission). In 2014 the private fundig of the Fraunhofer IME summed up to 44.5 % (see http://www.ime.fraunhofer.de/en/about_us/institute_data.html). In 2014 my personal fraction of industry work was about 17%. I spend all my office time for IME-activities. The time I spend for attending meetings of the BfR-Commission the IME-activity only covers 2 %. Due to this mission the Fraunhofer IME is doing studies for authorities (e.g. UBA), but also for the pesticide industry to be used in the regulatory risk assessment. However, as a research institute Fraunhofer IME does not do any decisions on regulatory risk assessment or risk management. IME is also not doing pesticide research in the meaning of development of new pesticides. Instead, pesticide risk research is important at the Fraunhofer IME. This research is generally financed with public money. I am involved in this research which is usually not related to individual compounds but to processes and principles. Some examples for pesticide risk research at the IME (all funded with public money) are: Validation of FOCUS PELMO for a reliable prediction of the leaching potential of PPP into groundwater in Germany, Geodata based Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Plant Protection Products (GEORISK), Development of German FOCUS type run-off and drainage scenarios, endocrine disruption in invertebrates (GERDA) - reproduction test using aquatic snails, concept development for extended plant testing of veterinary medicinal products, participation in the development and OECD validation of fish tests for endocrine disruption and biomagnification, hepatocyte assay to predict the bioaccumulation of chemicals in fish, development of a dietary burden calculator for fish metabolism studies, estimation of reasonable application dates related to crop development, Fish Full Life Cycle Test protocol development, chronic effects after peak vs. flow-through exposure. The fraction of industry funding in the area of pesticide risk research at the IME is negligible. However, IME is involved in the provision of experimental studies used for regulatory risk assessment. These fate and effect studies are always studies on specific pesticides or products performed according to guidelines. A substantial fraction of the total industry money at the IME is based on these studies (36 % in 2012 and 2013). I am not involved in any of these experimental studies and have no overview what is actually analysed in the institute. (continued, please find part 2)",

      "Part 2 of the description of employment: My general topic is calculation of the environmental fate. Since I started in 1987 I developed about 20 environmental fate models. The development of the fate models was mainly financed by German authorities (e.g. UBA). Since all models were developed as part of my employment I have no intellectual property rights. All these models are free of charge and their existences do not lead to any financial gain by my employer or by my self. I am involved in many projects financed by the UBA about fate aspect in risk assessment (pesticides, but also other regulations). I organize training lessons for the German authorities in the field of fate modelling and interpretation of experimental studies. I am partly involved in the assessment of the environmental fate of general chemicals according to the REACH regulation in co-operation with a sister institute. I am advising them about environmental exposure. In all external projects (independent whether I was involved or not) all money is provided directly to the accounts of IME. I am and was always only paid by Fraunhofer for my work.",

Aim of that project was the development of German FOCUS type surface water scenarios (GERDA). The model Gerda STEPS calculates time dependent pesticide concentrations in surface water (PECsw). The UBA has ownership and decides about distribution and use of the model. At the moment the model has no official status since the German authorities did not decide about using it for registration. Therefore, the model is currently also not available. If this situation changes in the future the model will be made available for everybody free of charge from an official website of the authority.",

According to the actual downloads it seems that the program is also used by other member states to calculate PECsoil, but I did not receive any official statement about that. It is expected that the German authorities will use the EFSA PECsoil models when they are released so that ESCAPE will loose it function",
