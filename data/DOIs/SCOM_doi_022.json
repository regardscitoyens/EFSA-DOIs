      "The research topic of our team is nutritional modulation of infection and inflammation. We study the mechanisms of action and regulation of nutritional factors in situations of inflammation and infection. Our hypotheses are that new nutritional components (mainly issued from breast milk) could influence: (i) the immune system (gene expression) early in life and prevent and/or modulate inflammatory diseases later in life, (ii) the course of inflammatory and/or infectious disease as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis. Our aim is to understand at different periods of prenatal and postnatal development the mechanisms by which nutritional components can influence future health and prevent/treat inflammatory diseases. The public funds received by our team (INSERM, FRM, Vaincre la Mucoviscidose, University Lille 2, Conseil R\u00e9gional du Nord-Pas de Calais) are used to support this research topic.",
