      "The Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) lays down the operational standards applicable to businesses and integrates all official control and inspection services for the safety of the food chain (microbiological and chemical food safety), animal and plant diseases and animal welfare. The Scientific Committee consists of scientific experts who are independent from the Agency and are employed by universities and research centers in Belgium. The Committee is completely autonomous and is in charge of risk assessment. It gives its opinion on draft regulations and on the control plans. Moreover, it sees to it that the Food Agency work proactively. It must identify problems in time and report them to allow the Agency to take the measures that are required, e.g. providing for an adequate survey system. The Scientific Committee has strictly no relation with risk management issues. The Scientific Committee has no activity related to the QPS mandate of EFSA. As expert I am involved in all microbiological safety issues the scientific committee is dealing with e.g. the risk assessment of listeria in smoked salmon, the risk and benefit analysis of the consumption of raw milk. The work on the evaluation of raw cows milk was finished in 2011 and the work on the evaluation of raw milk from other animals than cows in 2013. Both evaluations were published as advices on the internet of the Food Safety Agency. During 2014 an evaluation on the risks of consumption of raw dairy products will start. Risk assessment of genetically modified organisms does not belong to the tasks of the Food Agency and its scientific committee. Risk assessment of feed and food enzymes does not belong to the tasks of the Food agency and its scientific committee. With the committee we have 10 plenary meetings each of half a day spread over the year and about 10 working group meetings of half a day per year. As vice chair I have an additional 4 meetings of half a day per year (semestrial). I am vice chair of the committee since 2014. For the FAVV ILVO is also functioning as National Reference Centre for milk and milk products in which we are also responsible for the reference tasks for microbiological hazards.",

      "ILVO is carrying out field trials on the ILVO fields which fall under the control of the Units Plant and Animal Sciences. The unit Technology and Food, which falls under my responsibility, is delegating some collaborators to the central ILVO level for supporting and supervising the field trials with their expertise on the detection and the characterization of GMOs. The field trials are carried out by ILVO in collaboration with research instutes and universities: the University of Ghent, University College Ghent, the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology (VIB) and the University of Wageningen. In the trials different GMO lines developed by research instutes or universities are tested. In the trial of 2011 (not in 2012) one GM-potato line from BASF, already tested for several years under field conditions, was included as a positive reference. For using this control line in the field a contract was established between ILVO and BASF under the responsibility of the general director of ILVO. Personally, I was not directly involved in the field trial and I had no direct contacts with BASF. The field trial in 2012 and 2013 are carried out only by research institutes or universities without involvement of any private company.",
