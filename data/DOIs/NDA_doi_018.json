The expert group explored the available information/literatures on how markers of the immune system can be interpreted in terms of clinical relevance, especially in terms of beneficial and adverse effects on the immune system. The immunomodulation expert group was under ILSI Taskforce of Nutrition and immunity. No specific products or agents that modulate the imune system were being considered by the working group. I was member of this expert group. The aim was to provide a consensus opinion, but there is no obligation to sign the outcome of the excercise. For this activity there have been a total of around 5 meetings in the ILSI office in Brussels.",

      "Teaching Within the curriculum Post doctoral training Toxicology I am responsible for the course on immunotoxicology, i.e. how to assess the consequences in terms of immunosuppression, allergy, and autoimmunity as a result of exposure to chemicals. Research My main research line at Maastricht University is the implementation of toxicogenomics in the field of Immunotoxicology. Smaller areas are: immunotoxicity of statins, immunotoxicity of nanomaterials, assessment of developmental immunotoxicity. My appointment with Maastricht University is 20% of my time. About 50% of that time is devoted to implementation of toxicogenomics in immunotoxicity testing. Until December 2013 this latter activity was carried out in a project that was supported at the account of the Dutch Government (Netherlands Genomics Initiative), and in that project, 20% of the budget for the whole project was contributed in kind by a number of companies (chemical, drug, testing). These companies and their contribution to the project included: *BioDetection Systems B.V., NL. Bioassays for androgens and estrogens. *DNage/Pharming, NL Purifies, formulates and develops recombinant human proteins *Galapagos NV, BE Free license to adenoviral libraries, Chematica Chemogenomics Database and Admensa in silico optimization platform. *Janssen Research & Development Implementation and integration of in vitro assays, \u2018omics technologies and systems biology approaches. In vitro hepatoxicity tests, in vivo chronic toxicity studies. *Nikon Instruments Europe B.V., NL License to NIS Elements AR/6D Software, TE2000E-PFS live cell imaging microscope system *Organon/Schering Plough/Merck Knowledge on reproduction toxicity/teratogenicity, hepatoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity to provide context for test development *Pamgene, NL Development of toxicological biomarkers, array-based platform technologies *Phenion GmbH & Co.

In the project, model compounds were used for the reserach but no specific products offered by the participating industries were tested in the project, Maastricht University is not performing formal risk assessments other than for scientific reasons.
