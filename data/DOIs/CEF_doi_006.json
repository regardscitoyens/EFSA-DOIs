This activity comprises 6-7 days per year. The BeKo advises the BfR. Summarized results are published on the internet, including minority statements if a member requires it. Final decisions, however, are taken by the BfR. Subjects are the BfR recommendations, evaluation of substances, evaluations of petitions from industry, advise on on-going research work, standarization of methods and discussion of on-going regulatory work by other German government institutions.",

      "Enforcement of food legislation for the region of Zurich Enforcement work is based on existing legislation, but may include interpretation of the latter and of toxicological evaluation by competent authorities. It has no competence in toxicological evaluation. As an institution, measures are taken in case rules are violated, which reaches from informal communication up to confiscation of products. It is not my job to implement such measures, but to carry out analytical work to support the management decisions with data. I am head of the group with the technical competence in GC-based analysis. The main duty is the analysis of samples taken from the market and the development of new analytical methods. We also investigate subjects considered to be a potential problem and provide the competence in such matter for the decision to be taken. We also communicate with colleagues of other enforcement authorities to harmonize evaluation and measures. Main subjects dealt with in the past: - Chromatographic technology, particularly gas chromatography. - Adulteration of expensive edible oils, such as olive oils. - Mineral oil of various sources in foods, food packaging materials (printing inks, recycled fibers), human milk and body fat. - Saturated hydrocarbons as oligomers from polyolefins (POSH) - Migrants from food packaging materials, such as can coatings, plasticizers from gaskets of lids or toys, various components from paper and board, printing inks and varnishes. - Migration of cyclo-diBA from can coatings. - Acrylamide: sources, ways for mitigation primarily in potato products. - Components formed by raffination of edible oils and fats. - Safety evaluation of coatings applied to pipes for water supply in house installations. - Barrier against the migration from recycled paperboard: development of a method for measuring efficiency; evaluation of various polymers Occasionally samples are analyzed for industry against payment, e.g. for lid producers or for determining mineral oil in recycled board or food, but such work does not involve industry-financed research projects. The money is earned by the laboratory (state of Zurich). The scope is usually to support industry in developing solutions to problems brought up by us, particularly when no other laboratory is able to perform the analysis. We were involved as a partner of two projects of the German BMELV/BLE, the first of components in printing inks used for food contact materials, the second on substances getting in food contact from recycled board. Results were published on the website of the German BLE and in scientific journals. In 2011 and in 2013 the KLZH and the CVUA Stuttgart organized coordinated enforcement campaigns on the migration of plasticizers from the lids of glass jars into oils food. In particular we offered chemical analysis and evaluation of documentation for all MS, but left the management of the results to the MS. In 2013 we started work on an EFSA project on the toxicity of In 2014 we started evaluating the efficiency of various polymers as barriers against the migration from recycled paper and board; work paid by the Schweizerisches Verpackungsinstitut. I am officially retired as from July 2014, but continue working for the Kantonales Labor Z\u00fcrich as a 25 % job.",
