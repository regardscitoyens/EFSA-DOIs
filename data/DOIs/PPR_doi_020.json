The TM can adopt the advises, which are then used in the process for authorization of biocides. Role: member. The HEEG was an electronic working group (predominantly contact by email). During the period that I was a member there was one physical meeting, that I was not able to attend due to other obligations. The workload for the HEEG work was limited; about 10-15 day per year.

      "RIVM, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, NETHERLANDS, Bilthoven", 
      "As employee of RIVM I have been involved in the evaluation of pesticides and biocides for the purpose of authorization and regulation in the Netherlands or in the EU. Since 2002 I have been involved in JMPR as a temporary advisor and in 2011 and 2013 as a temporary advisor for JECFA. Role: evaluation of toxicological studies of, among others, pesticides and biocides, and drafting proposals for human health limit values (ADI, ARfD, AOEL, AEL). Since 2012 I have prepared advices for the risk managers at the Ministry of Health concerning environmental and process contaminants in the preparation for the DG SANCO expert committee meetings on this subject in Brussels. I have participated in these meetings in an advisory role to the representative of the Dutch ministry of Public Health. The principal task of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) is to support the Dutch government in formulating its policy, by collecting and integrating knowledge worldwide and to conduct research where needed. RIVM is funded only by public money. The Act on the RIVM of 1996 stipulates that commissioning bodies will not have any influence on the organization and outcome of RIVM\u2019s activities. RIVM is the official research facility for the ministries of \"Health Welfare and Sports\" and \"Infrastructure and the Environment\" in the Netherlands, and serves the Inspectorate for Public Health. RIVM also works for the ministries of \"Economic affairs, Agriculture, and Innovation\" and for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). RIVM is contracted by the Dutch Board for the Authorization of Pesticides and Biocides (Ctgb) to evaluate dossiers. RIVM has no vote in the authorisation of pesticides as such. RIVM has developed and published guidance or methodologies used in the regulatory process of pesticide authorisation and residue limits, and developed calculation tools and models in order to be transparant how proposed methodology is used. All programs have been paid for by public money and are available on a non-commercial basis.
