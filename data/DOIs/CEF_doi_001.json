      "Previously employed full-time at Fera (the Food and Environment Research Agency, formerly the Central Science Laboratory) which was an Agency of the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Fera was a not-for-profit full-costs-recovery government Agency of Defra. Fera offered, in open competition, its R&D and analytical services to bodies such as its parent department Defra and to other UK and non-UK Government departments, industry world-wide, the EU Research programmes, and consumer organisations. This included research projects and the analysis of samples for food and feed additives, residues, chemical migrants from packaging, markers of authenticity, and contaminants of all sorts. I was a civil servant. My salary was fixed and I had no other paid employment, contracted work, or fee income of any kind. I was most reently a member of the Food Quality & Safety programme within Fera. This programme had approximately 120 staff members plus visiting workers and students. The programme ran more than 130 projects pa for its customers and provided analytical services too. I retired from Fera on 31 March 2015.",

The funding for Fera in this project comes from the EU-FP7 (75%) with top-up funds from the UK Food Standards Agency. TDS-Exposure aims to standardise measurement of dietary chemicals throughout Europe and create an EU-wide network of TDS centers.",

      "I co-supervised a PhD student at the University of Leeds, School of Chemistry in 2010-13. The aim of his research was to gain a better understanding of the possible degradative release of melamine and related amino crosslinking materials, from polymeric coatings on metal substrates. The studentship was funded jointly by the Valspar Corporation, HJ Heinz and Fera. As well as myself, the other external supervisor of the student was Dr PK Oldring of the Valspar Corp. Establishing this PhD followed a very successful project between Fera and Leeds University, funded completely by the UK Government (Defra, LINK Project FQS-45, 2005-2008) and with HJ Heinz, Valspar Corp. and Impress as the 3 industrial partners. The project was entitled: New technologies and chemistries for food can coatings. FQS-45 resulted in 3 MSc theses, 2 PhD theses, plus a good number of journal publications.",

FACET stands for Flavours Additives and Contact materials Exposure Task. The WP4 had 8 partners including a Facet Industry Group (FIG) that was comprised of 12 European Trade Associations that cover all the major food packaging materials except for glass. Fera\u2019s participation in the FACET project was funded 75% by the European Commission, 15% by the FIG, and 10% by the UK Food Standards Agency. The FIG was a key partner in the FACET project since they provided information on packaging composition and usage which was key to being able to estimate consumer exposure. Consequently as workpackage leader I worked closely and frequently with the FIG on this project.",

I attended their first meetings, answered questions about EFSA\u2019s own work in this area, contributed to the development of scientific approaches, and reported back to the EFSA WG on FCMs. The first ILSI-NIAS meeting was in October 2011 and I ceased my participation in that group in June 2012 once that preliminary work was completed. I subsequently was invited and attended a workshop organised by ILSI Europe and held on 2-4 April 2014, in Brussels. The draft NIAS document was sent to all participants in advance of that workshop and it was stated by the organisers that a peer-reviewed publication covering the discussions would be produced soon after the workshop.",
