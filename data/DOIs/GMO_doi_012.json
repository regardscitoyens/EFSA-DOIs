      "As a Professor I must do my research activity in a research Institute linked to the University (an UMR). Therefore I am head of a Laboratory that belong to an UMR between CEA, CNRS and the University (UMR 7265). The lab is \"laboratoire de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique et Biophysique des Plantes\" belong to CEA Direction des Sciences du Vivant, Institute of Environmental Biology and Biotechnology. This a function, CEA is not my employer. The lab comprise about 10 permanent researchers from CEA, CNRS and University. I define research projects, apply for funding, mentor PhD student, perform experiments. Beside my teaching activity at the University that takes approximately half of my working time this research management takes my other half time (excluding other commissions and external duties) Further information on the Institute can be found: http://www- dsv.cea.fr/en/institutes/institute-of-environmental-biology-and- biotechnology-ibeb and the lab website is: http://www.lgbp.univ-mrs.fr/",
