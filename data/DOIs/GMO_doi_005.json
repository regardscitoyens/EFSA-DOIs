      "I am a member of the scientific committee of the French High Council for Biotechnology which : - is in charge of advising the French Government on issues relating to biotechnologies, including GMOs - assesses the potential risks to the environment and public health associated with GMOs, as well as their social and economic impact - was created in accordance with the June 2008 French law relative to GMOs, following a broad consultation on the environment in France, the \u201cGrenelle de l\u2019Environnement\u201d. HCB remit covers all fields of biotechnologies and is systematically consulted by the French CA for all GMO dossiers : - involving GM microorganisms, plants or animals, - for contained use or deliberate release, - for research, development, education, or commercial purposes, - in the sectors of agriculture, health, food and feed, energy and the environment. Scientific commitee met regularly (2 days per month) and I was mainly in charge of genetic and molecular studies of the GMO importation or GMO deliberate release dossiers. I was involved in generating comments (mostly on genetic molecular analysis) on GMO dossiers that have been sent to EFSA. I am also member of the scientific sub committee (of the scientific committee) in charge of the dossiers for contained use of GMOs which issues licences for French laboratories/hospitals to manipulate GMOs in contained conditions. In accordance with Dr E. Waigmann, Head of the GMO unit in EFSA and Dr JC Pag\u00e8s, pr\u00e9sident of the HCB Scientific Comittee, to avoid possible dual roles, I did not take part in any activity in the scientific committee of HCB that was related to EFSA. I do not contribute to dossiers viewed in parallel by the EFSA, which will restrain my contribution to contained-use and specifically French questions (laws...).",
