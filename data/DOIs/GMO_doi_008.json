      "High Council of Biotechnology", 
      "The \"Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies\" is the French scientific advisory body for GMOs which took over from the Commission du G\u00e9nie Biomol\u00e9culaire in 2009. The HCB is composed of a scientific committee (I was a member of) and a socio-economic committee. The scientific committee provides scientific opinions on biotech-related issues, including confined uses and deliberate releases in the Environment of GMOs. My field of expertise within the committee was agronomy in general, effects of cultivation practices of GMOs, gene flow and coexistence issues.These scientific opinions, together with recommendations from the socio-economic committee, are passed on to the Competent Authorities (Ministries of Environment, Research, Health and Agriculture). The Competent Authorities, taking into consideration the scientific advice, the socio-economic recommendations as well as other aspects (e.g., public consultation) make decisions about granting permits on deliberate releases of GMOs. To avoid possible dual roles, I did not take part in any activity in the scientific committee of HCB that was related to EFSA such as providing EFSAnet input.",
