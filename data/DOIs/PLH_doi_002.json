This laboratory, UMR 1332 Biology du Fruit et Pathology counts about 130 permament or non permanent staff. Research activities focused on the study of plant-virus interactions, diagnostics and characterisation of new plant viruses. No activities on DNA viruses or whitefly borne agents. I am one of the members of a small group of scientist created by the Plant Health division of INRA to adress phytosanitary crises and coordinate the division readiness. I am involved in cooordinating INRA's response to a range of lawsuits in which a number of French growers are suing INRA claiming that INRA is responsible for introducing the M strain of PPV in France in the 1980's and, as such, ultimately responsible for PPV outbreaks that affected their orchards. In this capacity, I interact with both INRA researchers with a knowledge of PPV, of its epidemiology or of historical aspects of work with Prunus crops at INRA in the 1970's to 1990's. I also interact with INRA's lawyers with the ultimate goal to assist the lawyers in the production of documents and argumentation used for INRA's defense (scientific syntheses on knowledge on Sharka, rebutal of INRA opponents theses etc...).",
