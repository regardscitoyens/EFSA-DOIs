      "Member of the Committee for Exposure Assessment and Exposure Standardization and of the Committe for Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Novel Foods and Allergies The differences between EFSA panels and BfR committees are based on statutory provisions, in particular regulation (EG) 178/2002. BfR expert committees act in a purely advisory capacity and have no decision function. The work of the committees set up at BfR is aimed to enable the Institute to raise the scientific quality of its opinions on food safety and consumer protection as regards human health through external expertise. Results of the committees work are published in the form of minutes on the internet. For adoption of a resolution of the committees, members are entitled to vote. Crucial for the membership in BfR committees is the degree of scientific expertise. Members of the committees undertake to act independently without being influenced by any external source. As within the scientific panels of EFSA, any potential conflicts of interest of the members have to be declared. The essential information on the function of BfR committees is given in a press release on the newly set up of the 14 BfR committees in 2008 and can be accessed via the following link: (http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/press_information/2008/08/bfr_sets_up_na tional_expert_committees_for_food_safety_and_consumer_protection- 11115.html). The frequency of meetings of the committees has been twice per year or less.",
