      "Vetagro sup (VAS)", 
      "-VAS (Vetagro sup) is the new name for the College of Veterinary Medicine of Lyon, France. It is a college for veterinary education and veterinart research. It is a public institution. - VAS participates in the development of rodenticides with my research unit (financial support for 1 personnel) -VAS is not involved in regulatory assessment of PPP -VAS has not published RA guidance or methodologie for regulatory processes -VAS is not owner of software/computational models used in regulatory assessment of PPP. -VAS has no official capacity in Risk management I am professor of pharmacy and toxicology and head of the Basic Science Unit. As such, I am mostly involved in teaching veterinary pharmacy and toxicology but also in the research team dealing with resistance to rodenticides in rodents. My main area of research is terrestrial ecotoxicology, especially with rodenticides. Personnally, as an employee in VAS - I am involved in a research unit working on rodenticide resistance and we have grants from the Ministry of Education and Research as well as from Liphatech Inc. to work on new rodenticides (used as biocidal products). The deliverables include project reports, study reports and scientific publications. It is likely that some of the scientific findings may be used in the development of new rodenticides. - I have been involved personnally with the French commission for PPP registration from 1998 until 2009. It is now under the supervision of Anses and is the National French Agency for Food Safety and present at EU meetings on PPP - there is no contract between EFSA and VAS in which I could be involved. - I prepared a report for the EU commission, on behalf of VAS on risk mitigation measures for anticoagulant rodenticides (end of program in November 2014).",
