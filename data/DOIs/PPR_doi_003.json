      "Member of the Scientific Committee of the Foundation Rovaltain, a public, non-profit organisation for research in ecotoxicology and environmental toxicology. The Foundation Rovaltain was created by the French Ministry for Higher Education and Research in July 2013 (decree ESRR1311420D published July 12th, 2013 in the French Official Journal). The source of funding of the Foundation Rovaltain are provided by public founding members including Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and Dr\u00f4me Council, Ecoparc Rovaltain, several French schools and universities, Chamber of commerce and industry of Dr\u00f4me but also the public/private organization \"Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne\" which is operating the Rh\u00f6ne river for energy production, navigation and irrigation. The members of the Scientific Committee of the Foundation of Scientific Cooperation Rovaltain have an advising role regarding the scientific activities of this Public Foundation. These activities are from the domain of scientific animation (summer schools, Scientific days, support of projects). They are not linked to and do not compete with any private organisation. Furthermore the Administration Committee of the Foundation are responsible for decisional aspects. The scientific Committee has no role in this respect.

      "I am a temporary External expert in ANR for 3 years (2011-2013) (National Research Agency, France) for the evaluation and selection of research applications to be granted for the section \u00ab Contaminants et Environnements : Sant\u00e9, Adaptabilit\u00e9, Comportements et Usages \u00bb within the programme \"Environment and Biological Resources\" The ANR is a research funding organisation. It was established by the French government in 2005 to fund research projects, based on competitive schemes giving researchers the best opportunities to realize their projects and paving the way for ground-breaking new knowledge. The role of the Agency is to bring more flexibility to the French research system, foster new dynamics and devise cutting edge- strategies for acquiring new knowledge. By identifying priority areas and fostering private-public collaborations, it also aims at enhancing the general level of competitiveness of both the French research system and the French economy. Project-based research funding is known to stimulate research organisations and strengthen their synergies. The ANR\u2019s approach to funding allows French research to reinforce its international position and better integrate the framework of European cooperation. ANR funds are available in all scientific fields, for both fundamental and industrial research and for public research organisations as well as private companies (through public/private partnerships). With a peer review process matching the highest international standards, ANR\u2019s general goal is to fund excellent research, while also facilitating innovation and interdisciplinary work and developing European and international collaborations. The ANR is constantly attentive to the scientific community. Indeed, consulting the scientific community each year on the future needs in both fundamental and applied research is one of the agency\u2019s priorities. The ANR\u2019s goal is to identify themes which can respond not only to societal, environmental and economic needs, but also to technological and scientific challenges, through a broad consultation process. In order to enrich its portfolio of thematic programmes with the most strategic considerations, the Agency therefore implements a continuous foresight and programme planning process in which it consults the widest possible range of national and international stakeholders. ANR's programmes are organised in 6 thematic priorities: \u2022Environment and Biological Resources \u2022Engineering, Processes and Security \u2022Health and Biology \u2022Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies \u2022Sustainable Energy \u2022Social Sciences and Humanities Since July 2010, ANR's programme planning and selection processes are ISO 9001 certified.",

Personally, I act as a risk assessor and I am not empowered to validate/take management action/decisions. Duties as scientific officer: # Environmental risk assessment of active substances - preparation of DARs for the EU review programme as Rapporteur Member State; peer review and commenting on active substances in the European evaluation process - Environmental risk assessment in the national authorisation of plant protection products; indication of areas of concern requiring risk mitigation measures # Ecotoxicology of plant protection products - integration of new scientific developments in the evaluation of PPP ecotoxicity to non-target organisms - implementation of new environmental risk assessment schemes in authorization procedures - ecotoxicological assessment of active substances/plant protection products (e.g. study validation, higher tier test evaluation) Furthermore, UBA is Associated Partner in the Marie Curie Initial Training Network, EU FP7 \u201c CREAM Mechanistic Effect Models for Ecological Risk Assessment of Chemicals\u201d; I am responsible for the UBA partnership.",
