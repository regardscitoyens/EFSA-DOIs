The Netherlands Society of Toxicology doesnot expressly intend to represent the legal interests of individual risk assessors (or toxicologists in general), unless these interests are directly related to the overall practice of the discipline of toxicology as stipulated in Article 3 of the Statute (NVT). My actual contribution included: 1) being the representative of the Dutch governemental risk assessors (i.e. toxicologists); 2) charge to bring in scientific topics/issues/agenda of a Food authority and 3) co-organiser and host of the section meetings. The frequency of the meetings attended was about 6 times/year with an average time of 4 hours per meeting. In addition, annually two section meetings (workshops) have been organised taken an average time of about 4 days/workshop.",

      "Member of the Board of Counsellors of the RiskRegulatoryReflex (RRR) program with regard a scientific project sponsored in the context of the Dutch Risk and Responsibility (DRRP) program financed by the ministry of BZK. BZK started a policy program aimed at developing a vision on government's role in regard to risks, as well as a set of tools for government to handle risks and incidents in a proportionate manner. The program DRRP has studied and discussed the ; risk regulation reflex', which is a combination of the trend towards ever more far-reaching preventive safety measures which carry the chance of imbalance between the gain in safety and the costs and side effects, together with the pitfall of a hasty response following an incident leading to disproportionate maesures. My scientific consultancy activity related to the enrollment of the project 'risico's in perspectief. De risicoregelreflex te lijf met een nuchtere vergelijking van risico's' (running from 2013 to the end of 2014). The nature of the advice is to evaluate the development of tools for public administrators and civil servants in dealing with risks proportionately, especially under public pressure. As member I took account of insights, needs and experiences from the standpoint of a Food Safety authority. The committee convened three meetings/year with the projectteam (time about 4 hours/meeting), and activities were not linked to GMOs.",

Thereto, twice a year (half day meeting) the advisory committee reviews the workplans in the following year and evaluates the progress of the ongoing year (including an assessment report on output, management and outcome). Projects of this theme relate to GMOs and novel food and the assessment of complex foods (mixtures) by innovative tools like omics.
