      "Toxicological risk assessment (pesticides, biocides, chemicals) I have been the Head of the Department of Safety of Substances and Products. This included besides the responsibility for the staff (up to 100 persons) responsibility for the human health assessments on industrial chemicals in the European regulatory assessment scheme for new and existing chemicals; since 2005 responsibility for the human health assessments on pesticides and biocides in the relevant European regulatory assessment schemes, responsibilities for research in several fields among them also work on TTC. A.o. I wrote an article published in Toxicology Letter as the senior author which deals with TTC application in the field of reprotoxicicity. At my time in the office, there was no regulatory position concerning the application of the TTC concept and I was not involved in drafting an opinion on the issue. On behalf and upon instruction of my employer I have served from 2005 until end of 2008 as a non-paid Scientific Advisor to the Research Foundation Council of Scientific Advisors of ILSI where I have been evaluating intramural research proposals submitted by ILSI branches once a year together with other panel members by ranking them in an order. The projects covered a broad range of research fields. Some examples were: Promotion of Classroom-Based Physical Activity, Project on physical activity promotion to fight obesity, Educational Efforts to Use Tools for Risk Assessment, A risk management tool to establish thresholds for food allergens, Iron Deficiency Elimination Action, Osteoporosis prevention by enhanced Calcium intake, Advice was given to prioritize the following fields in research : Predictive Modelling by probabilitic modelling techniques applied to the level of health risk, and on the uncertainty/Variability analysis; Relationships between genetic make up and nutrition, health risk and health promoting behaviours; Children's health, Endocrine disruptors ,Training course in the use of FAO/WHO Risk Analysis Manual in developing countries, Levels of no concern/virtually safe levels for genotoxic carcinogens\"",
