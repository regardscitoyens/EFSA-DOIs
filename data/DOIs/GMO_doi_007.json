      "I'm Senior research and and attended professor in Agricultural Entomology, in 2014 I had the National licence to be associated professor. She is in the Committee for the Ph.D School of Animal Biology (Faculty of Science University of Palermo). 2007-2009 Controller of Examinations for the Ph.D of the Agricultural Faculty of Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, INDIA. 2007-2009 professor of Applied entomology, Adaptative Zoology, Invertebrate zoology, Zoology at the University of Palermo. 2001- 2007 she was professor for the courses: Biotechnology applied to arthropods, Defence of the plants: entomology, Effects of the biotechnology on the environment: entomology at the UNiversity of Milano. 2001-2014 She was tutor and co-tutor of 40 diploma thesis and 2 PhD thesis. Interests: Agricultural entomology, Nematology, Soil biodiversity, Impact of Biotechnology and Pesticides on the enviroment, Biosafety, Interaction between pest and Bt toxins, Interaction between Bacillus thuringiensis and insect, bioindicators, soil fauna and impact of xenobiotics. Approved a project financed by University of Palermo on impact of GM plant on soil fauna. Impact of Biopesticides on non target arthropods and other invertebrates. My research do not supports in any way the development of particular pesticides in view their registration. I collaborate to the published Risk Assessment guidance of GMP as ad hoc expert of EFSA in GMO non target group. At the moment I'm not involved in research or studies regarding methodology, software and/or computational model which could be used in regulatory processes regarding plant protection products or not and whether it is involved in the regulatory risk assessment process of pesticides or not. My research regards only in part the effect of pesticides on non target organisms but considering aspects that actually are not necessary for the registration process or different non target organisms.",
