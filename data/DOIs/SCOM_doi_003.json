      "Consultancy of projects at the Department of Biostatistics of the German Cancer Research Center which started before end of regular employment in February 2010 and which had not been finished by that time or which were extended by the collaborators afterwards. The number of such ongoing or re-opened projects has been since February 2010 less than five and requires work forf 2-5 meetings per year. The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) is a Foundation of Public Law located in Im Neuenheimer Feld 280 | 69120 Heidelberg Germany. The legal remit is to perform research on cancer and described in full detail in https://www.dkfz.de/de/dkfz/download/Satzung.pdf. The expert's role in the organization and his/her main tasks during the employment from 1979 to 2010 was to perform biostatistical research to support the centers remit by in the design and analysis of experimental and clinical studies of the research on cancer. The organisation does not make direkt use of the results of this work, except registering scientific puablication in its reports The work is restricted to give advice in design, evaluation of the data and publication of the results of biomedical studies related to cancer. The organisation has no official responsibility to carry out risk management and is exclusively engaged in the science risk assessment and evaluation related to the incidence and treatment of cancer. The work reported here concerns also Biostatistical research and application of mathematical and statistical methods in the 7th Framework Project BASELINE EU Grant Agreement No 222 738 in a part time contract of 12-34 h/months which ends in 2013 The BASELINE project's objective is to provide harmonised and validated sampling strategies, to support the European policies in food safety and to be suitable for food producers, in order to collect comparable data to improve quantitative risk analysis of selected biological and chemical agents. My work for the project is to support workpackage 6 (WP6) on Model Development by supportimg the WP 6 leader located at the DKFZ in the development of predictive mathematical models for biological risks and investigate and model sources and pathways of chemical contaminants to improve sampling schemes. This is obtained by a review of existing and definition of new mathematical models in predictive microbiology; investigation of correlations between food risk factors and traceable environmental parameters and contamination indicators; consolidation of existing and new models for microbial growth as a function of intrinsic environmental factors and extrinsic parameters. This refers to the previous work for the project done in the function as previous Department Head and previous WP 6 Leader which ended by retirement from the DKFZ in 2010 reported under VI.
