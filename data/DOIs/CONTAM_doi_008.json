PUBLIC FUNDING The main objectives in this project are 1.to examine if chemical mineral speciation analysis can be used as a predictive measure of apparent mineral digestibility in Atlantic salmon 2.to study mineral bioavailability through examining intestinal routes, rates of uptake and distribution of different chemical forms of minerals in vitro 3.to estimate practical and conditional requirements of Zn, Mn and Se in future feeds for Atlantic salmon, mainly in the seawater phase, based on established and novel biomarkers 4.Based on dietary mineral feed level, digestibility, feed intakes and mineral retentions in feeding trials we will calculate the environmental load of micro minerals in salmon farming under variable farming conditions,and including use of triploid salmon.",

The method of diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) emulates some aspects of the dynamics, but it lacks some essential features of the organism. This project introduced controlled biological features into DGT and provided two new tools that can be used in situ to assess bioavailable metals. The biological binding DGT (BBDGT) incorporated cell cultures to enable precise mimicry of uptake from solution. The biological mobilising DGT (BMDGT) contained microbial components that enable the measurement of metals capable of release from colloids and particles.",
