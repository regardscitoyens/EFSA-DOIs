      "I was a full independent scientific member of this committee- the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. The committee was established by act of parliament. DEFRA ministers were required by law to consider the advice it presented through its chairperson. It had a regulatory role for the approval of pesticides within the UK and provided input to European approvals processes when the UK was acting as Rapporteur Member State. The committee operated by consensus and did not generally vote but if a vote were taken I would have had one. Equally if a report conclusion by the majority was unacceptable to me as a full member I had the right to express a minority view. As the committee was a legal entity set up by act of parliament and appointments and renewals of membership such as mine were made by government ministers.Expenses and Honorarium for each meeting to cover preparation corresponding to about 1.4% % of my annual income for 6 meetings per annum.
