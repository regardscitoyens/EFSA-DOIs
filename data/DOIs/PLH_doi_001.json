No role in decision making processes or in management measures. I am Scientific officer for the High Council for biotechnologies (secretariat), especially in charge of arranging and coordinating expertises and research (contracts with independant research teams)on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in relation with scientific, agronomic, environmental, economic and social aspects.
