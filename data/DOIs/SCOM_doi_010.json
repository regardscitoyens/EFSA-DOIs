CVERA is Ireland's national resource centre in veterinary epidemiology and animal disease control. These two roles substantially overlap. In my professorial role, I undertake a broad range of scholarly activity, including research, teaching and service/innovation. In my role as CVERA Director, I lead scientific research and provide scientific advice to inform national policy decision-making in the areas of animal health and welfare. This work is conducted within the following three broad themes: a. Scientific research and advice, including contributions to committees, to support the control and eradication of regulatory animal diseases, including bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. These programmes are managed by the national Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM). b. Scientific research and advice, including contribution to committees, to support the control and/or eradication of a range of non-regulatory animal health concerns of cattle, including mastitis, Johne's disease and bovine viral diarrhoea. In Ireland, these issues are primarily managed by Animal Health Ireland (AHI). c. Scientific research and advice, including contribution to several national committees of DAFM and the national Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), on a broad range of other animal health and welfare issues relating to emergency animal disease preparedness and response, on-farm investigations, welfare of farmed livestock and horses, health of companion animals and farmed fish, and international collaboration.",

The Centre was initially established as the Tuberculosis Investigation Unit, but in recent years has broadened its remit to cover a wide range of international, national and local animal health matters, including: \u2022 Epidemiological support for the control and eradication of regulatory animal diseases, which includes national programmes for bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and bovine spongiform encephalopathy; \u2022 Work in support of Animal Health Ireland, which is seeking to provide a proactive, coordinated and industry-led approach in Ireland to non-regulatory animal health concerns (such as mastitis, fertility and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis); and \u2022 Epidemiological support for a broad range of other animal health and welfare issues relating to emergency animal disease preparedness and response (for example, avian influenza, bluetongue and equine infectious anaemia), on-farm investigations, welfare of farmed livestock and horses, health of companion animals and farmed fish, and international collaboration. UCD CVERA staff work closely with national policy-makers, both in government and industry. Staff also contribute to training in veterinary medicine, both to undergraduates and postgraduate. A broad range of expertise is represented within the Centre, including agriculture and animal sciences, database development and management, geographic information systems, statistics, veterinary medicine and epidemiology.
