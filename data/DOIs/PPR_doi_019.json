Department of Bioscince employer dos not support in any way the development of particular pesticides in view their registration. It does not have rights or ownership of any published Risk Assessment guidance, methodology, software and/or computational model which could be used in regulatory processes regarding plant protection products. It is not involved in the regulatory risk assessment process of pesticides. It has no official capacity of Risk Management (authorisation of PPPs, MRL setting, control and monitoring activities). It does, however, carry out strategic research funded by DK national authorities and research councils which may evaluate and develop methodology, or collect data, for purposes of developing new and better approaches to risk assessment.",

It occupies approximately 25% of my time. This project does not interfere with EFSA working groups, except to provide experience on which to base advice.",
