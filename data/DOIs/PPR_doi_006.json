      "The Danish Environment Protection Agency (EPA) \u2013 division of Pesticides and Gene technology (P&G) The legal remits of the Danish EPA, P&G are: \u2022Risk assessment and authorisations of pesticides and biocides. \u2022Development of national guidance for regulatory risk assessment of Pesticides and Biocides \u2022Development of regulation on pesticides and biocides in the EU and the administration of these EU-legislation \u2022This does not include research activities, studies of pesticides in view of their authorisations and ownership of software/computational models used in the regulatory process \u2022The Danish EPA uses publically available models for risk assessment of pesticides, but does not owe models or software applicable in the regulatory assessment of pesticides The Danish EPA financially supports general research in effects of pesticides on the environment and on human health with the aim for reducing the impact of pesticides on environment and human health. However, the Danish EPA, does not select which project should be supported (this is done by the National Research Council). The Danish EPA manages the different projects by steering committees, where researchers and employees of the Danish EPA are participants. During my employment at the Danish EPA (P&G) I have worked/I work as a toxicologist (since 2015 \u00edn position as senior advisor) with the following duties: \u2022Risk assessment of pesticides and biocides (biocides until medio 2010). \u2022Quality assurance of the risk assessment of pesticides and biocides, in relation to national authorisations and/or Northern Zone authorisations. This work and the previous mentioned does not include risk management decisions at my position level. \u2022Drafting of Annex I Draft Assessment Reports (DAR) section on mammalian toxicology \u2022Commenting on other member states DARs and participation as a national expert for the government in expert meetings (PRAPeR) \u2022Member of the steering committee on research projects on pesticides relating to impact on human health funded by the Danish EPA \u2022Since 2011 technical support to the Chemicals Division of the Danish EPA on issues relating to endocrine disrupters and cumulative effects \u2022The Danish EPA has initiated a project on the refinement of the cumulative risk assessment of pesticides and biocides at the Danish Technical University (DTU). The project is an in silico project developing computer-based methods (PBTK - physiology based toxicokinetics and QSAR - quantitative structure activity relationsships) refine the cumulative risk assessment of pesticides and biocides. This project is in part based on data generated from the EFSA supported project on identification of cumulative assessment groups of pesticides at the DTU. I will be part of the steering committee. \u2022From autumn 2011 I will be part of a steering group on two projects at the Danish Centre on Endocrine disrupters. The two projects are on combination effects/grouping of endocrine disruptors (animal studies on combinations of low doses of chemicals - including pesticides) and \u2022Since spring 2011 input to EU PARERE (preliminary Assessment of regulatory Relevance) under ECVAM (European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods), JRC (Joint Research Centre).",
